# Excel Templates

This folder contains ready-to-use Excel templates (typically `.xlsm`) that demonstrate how to use the StructEngLib add-in in real workflows.

## Planned templates (Phase 1)

- `BeamDesignSchedule.xlsm` — batch design (10–50 beams) + one-click DXF export
- `QuickDesignSheet.xlsm` — single-beam quick design sheet
- `ComplianceReport.xlsm` — compliance checking and reporting

## Notes

- Templates may depend on `Excel/StructEngLib.xlam` being loaded.
- Keep units explicit in headers (mm, kN, kN·m, N/mm²).
