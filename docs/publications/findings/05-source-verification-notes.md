# Source Verification Notes — Evidence Upgrade Pass

**Date:** 2025-12-31
**Owner:** RESEARCHER
**Scope:** Strengthen primary/secondary sources for real‑world case studies and BDAS/BCA claims before edits.

---

## Verified Sources (Initial Pass)

### 1) Standard Chartered PRA Fine (Primary / Regulatory)
**Source:** Bank of England (PRA) final notice
**URL:** https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2021/december/pra-final-notice-to-standard-chartered-bank-dated-20-december-2021
**Evidence level:** 🟢 PRIMARY (regulatory authority)
**Notes:** Page title explicitly states the £46,550,000 fine; use this as the primary citation instead of EuSpRIG aggregation.

---

### 2) UK COVID‑19 Excel Error (Secondary / News)
**Source:** BBC News
**URL:** https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54423988
**Evidence level:** 🟡 SECONDARY (news reporting)
**Notes:** Confirms Excel row‑limit issue and the 16,000 cases figure. Still prefer a UK government or PHE/DHSC release as primary if available.

---

### 3) BCA Buildability/BDAS Framework (Secondary / Government Guidance)
**Source:** Building and Construction Authority (Singapore)
**URL:** https://www1.bca.gov.sg/buildsg/productivity/buildability-buildable-design-and-constructability
**Evidence level:** 🟡 SECONDARY (government guidance page; not empirical study)
**Notes:** Page references Buildable Design Appraisal System (BDAS). Use for “BCA promotes buildability scoring” phrasing; keep productivity claims tied to Poh & Chen (1998).

---

## Sources Still Needed (Open Items)

### A) Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund Spreadsheet Error (Primary/Secondary)
**Current:** EuSpRIG aggregation only
**Gap:** No direct primary or mainstream source located in initial pass
**Action:** Find official Norges Bank / NBIM statement or credible reporting; if not found, remove or generalize the example.

---

### B) UK COVID Excel Error — Primary Source
**Current:** BBC secondary source
**Gap:** Government technical‑issue update (PHE/DHSC or GOV.UK)
**Action:** Locate official government release to upgrade evidence level.

## Search Notes (What to Try Next)

**UK GOV:**
- gov.uk search API: `https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json?q=...`
- Queries: “technical issue update Excel Test and Trace”, “16,000 cases Excel”, “Public Health England Excel error”.

**Norway case:**
- Queries: “Norges Bank benchmark error spreadsheet”, “NBIM date entry error benchmark”, “NKr 980 million benchmark error”.
- Try NBIM press releases or annual reports.

---

## Recommendation for Later Edits

- Replace EuSpRIG as the citation for the Standard Chartered fine with the PRA final notice.
- Keep the BBC link for the UK case unless a GOV.UK primary source is found.
- Remove or generalize the Norway case until a verifiable primary/secondary source is located.
