# Learning Hub (Beginner-Friendly)

This folder is a guided learning path for this repo. It is written for an engineer
who is new to software projects, but wants to understand the concepts and code.

If you are already comfortable with Python/VBA, you can move faster. If not, take
it step by step. The goal is confidence, not speed.

## Recommended order (start here)

1) learning-plan.md
2) concepts-map.md
3) glossary.md
4) exercises.md
5) guides.md

## Two tracks (pick one)

### Track A: Use the library
- Start: docs/getting-started/beginners-guide.md
- Then: docs/getting-started/python-quickstart.md
- Then: docs/cookbook/cli-reference.md

### Track B: Maintain the library
- Start: docs/architecture/project-overview.md
- Then: docs/architecture/deep-project-map.md
- Then: docs/reference/api.md
- Then: docs/contributing/testing-strategy.md

## What you will be able to do
- Run the full pipeline (CSV -> JSON -> BBS -> DXF)
- Understand the output schema and compliance summary
- Trace a design calculation to the exact module and test
- Safely modify code and verify changes
