## 🛤️ Two Tracks (Pick One)

### Track A: Use the Library (Engineers)

```
Step 1: docs/getting-started/beginners-guide.md     → Understand the basics
Step 2: docs/getting-started/python-quickstart.md   → Run your first calculation
Step 3: docs/cookbook/cli-reference.md              → Use the command line
Step 4: docs/cookbook/python-recipes.md             → Common patterns
```

### Track B: Maintain the Library (Developers)

```
Step 1: docs/architecture/project-overview.md       → System architecture
Step 2: docs/architecture/deep-project-map.md       → Code organization
Step 3: docs/reference/api.md                       → API reference
Step 4: docs/contributing/testing-strategy.md       → Testing patterns
```
