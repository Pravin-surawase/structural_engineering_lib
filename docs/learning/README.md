# Learning Hub (Beginner-Friendly)

This folder is a guided learning path for this repo. It is written for an engineer
who is new to software projects, but wants to understand the concepts and code.

If you are already comfortable with Python/VBA, you can move faster. If not, take
it step by step. The goal is confidence, not speed.
