# Documentation Images

This folder contains images referenced by the documentation (e.g., the Excel tutorial screenshots).

## Excel tutorial screenshots

The file [docs/_internal/screenshot-guide.md](../_internal/screenshot-guide.md) lists the target screenshot filenames (e.g., `excel-tutorial-01-addin-install.png`).

Place the PNGs in this folder so the markdown image links in the tutorials render correctly.
