## 2025-12-27 — v0.9.5 Release + Docs Restructure

### Decisions

1. **PyPI Publishing:** Implemented Trusted Publishing (OIDC) workflow. No API tokens needed.
2. **Docs restructure:** Approved 7-folder structure with redirect stubs. Files staying at root: `README.md`, `TASKS.md`, `AI_CONTEXT_PACK.md`, `RELEASES.md`, `v0.7_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `v0.8_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md`.
3. **VBA parity scope:** Limited to critical workflows (design, compliance, detailing), not every function.

## 2025-12-27 — API/CLI Docs UX Pass (Phases 0–4)

### Decisions

1. **CLI is canonical:** Unified CLI (`python -m structural_lib design|bbs|dxf|job`) is the default reference; legacy CLI entrypoints are treated as legacy.
2. **Docs must match code:** Examples are kept copy-paste runnable with real signatures and outputs.
3. **No breaking API changes:** This pass updates docs and docstrings only.

### Changes

- Updated public API docstrings with args/returns/examples (`Python/structural_lib/api.py`).
- Aligned CLI reference to actual CLI behavior (`docs/cookbook/cli-reference.md`).
- Fixed Python recipes to use real function signatures (`docs/cookbook/python-recipes.md`).
- Corrected DXF and spacing examples in beginners guide (`docs/getting-started/beginners-guide.md`).
- Updated legacy CLI reference in v0.7 mapping spec (`docs/specs/v0.7_DATA_MAPPING.md`).

### Status

- Phase 0–5 complete.
