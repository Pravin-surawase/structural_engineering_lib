## 2025-12-27 — v0.9.5 Release + Docs Restructure

### Decisions

1. **PyPI Publishing:** Implemented Trusted Publishing (OIDC) workflow. No API tokens needed.
2. **Docs restructure:** Approved 7-folder structure with redirect stubs. Files staying at root: `README.md`, `TASKS.md`, `AI_CONTEXT_PACK.md`, `RELEASES.md`, `v0.7_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `v0.8_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md`.
3. **VBA parity scope:** Limited to critical workflows (design, compliance, detailing), not every function.
