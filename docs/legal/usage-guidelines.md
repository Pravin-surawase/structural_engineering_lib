advice.

---

## 1. Intended Users

This library is intended for use by licensed professional engineers (or those
working under their direct supervision). If you are not qualified to practice
structural engineering in your jurisdiction, do not rely on this software for
design decisions.

## 2. Verification Requirements

Before any design is accepted or issued:

- Independently verify all calculations
- Check assumptions, units, and boundary conditions
- Validate outputs against code provisions and known checks
- Review detailing for constructability and compliance

## 3. Code & Jurisdiction Compliance

- Confirm the applicable code edition and any local amendments
- Ensure the library's assumptions match project requirements
- Maintain a record of code references and verification steps

## 4. Professional Sign-Off

All final designs must be reviewed, sealed, and signed by a qualified
professional engineer in accordance with local regulations. Software output
alone is not sufficient for professional sign-off.

## 5. Reporting & Documentation

For auditability and professional practice:

- Retain input data, assumptions, and calculation outputs
- Store reports with version and date metadata
- Keep a log of verification checks performed

## 6. Disclaimer

Use of this library implies acceptance of the terms in `LICENSE_ENGINEERING.md`
and the main project `LICENSE` file.
