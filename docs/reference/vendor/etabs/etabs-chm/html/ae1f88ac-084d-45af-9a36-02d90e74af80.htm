				Beginning with Version 18, ETABS includes a new set of database tables that allow significantly better interactive editing capability
				(similar to other CSI programs, such as SAP2000 and SAFE).
				For API users who wish to take advantage of these interactive tables, a new class has been added, <span class="code">cDatabaseTables</span>.
				It is recommended that API users first familiarize themselves with the new database tables using the ETABS GUI,
				to understand how data can be requested, viewed, modified, and applied to the model.
			</p><p>
				Generally, you will start with a call to the API function <span class="code">GetAvailableTables</span>.
				Then decide which tables you want to retrieve data from or edit and apply to the model.
				Call <span class="code">GetAllFieldsInTable</span> to see which columns each table of interest has,
				and which columns can be edited and imported.
			</p><p>
				To simply retrieve data, use one of the <span class="code">GetTableForDisplay...</span> functions.
				Results can be obtained for the entire model or for a specified group to reduce the amount of data produced.
				Functions are provided to set the Load Cases, Load Combinations, and Load Patterns for which data is desired.
				Use the <span class="code">SetOutputOptionsForDisplay</span> function to set other options for display.
			</p><p>
				To edit a table and apply it the model, start by calling one of the <span class="code">GetTableForEditing...</span> functions.
				This will retrieve the table data in one of several formats (array, CSV string, or CSV file).
				You can then modify that data, but ensure that the format of the data is not altered.
				In particular, you can add and delete rows, but the columns should not be changed.
				After editing the table, send it back to the model using the respective <span class="code">SetTableForEditing...</span> function.
				These functions only operate on one table at a time, but you can edit any number of tables by calling them successively.
			</p><p>
				Finally, call <span class="code">ApplyEditedTables</span> to actually apply the edited tables to the model.
				Note that no changes are made to the model using the <span class="code">SetTableForEditing...</span> functions,
				these simply build the list of tables to be processed when calling <span class="code">ApplyEditedTables</span>.
				If for any reason you want to clear this internal list of edited tables instead of applying the changes,
				call the <span class="code">CancelTableEditing</span> function.
				Note that it is recommended that you work with groups of related tables and apply them all at once,
				rather than editing and applying tables one at a time. This helps with data consistency and is also more efficient.
			</p><p>
				For thorough descriptions of database table operations,
				please refer to the individual function documentation in <span class="code">cDatabaseTables</span>.
				For detailed examples of database table interaction using the API, please see the Examples section.
