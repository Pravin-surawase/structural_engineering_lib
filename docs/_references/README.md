# Reference Materials (Local)

This folder is intended for **local** reference materials you want to cite/summarize into the project docs (especially the research log).

## What to put here
- PDFs you own/have rights to use (course notes, your internal notes, vendor manuals)
- Your own spreadsheets (worked examples, benchmark calculations)
- Images or screenshots of worked examples you want summarized

## How it’s used
- These files are **not** used by the library at runtime.
- They exist to make it easy to:
  - extract benchmark examples into `docs/RESEARCH_AI_ENHANCEMENTS.md`
  - derive test cases in `Python/tests/`
  - document assumptions and verification steps

## Naming suggestions
- Prefer descriptive names, e.g.:
  - `CE371_beam_serviceability_notes.pdf`
  - `beam_benchmarks_M25_Fe500.xlsx`
  - `bbs_cutting_stock_examples.xlsx`

## Copyright / licensing
- Do not add copyrighted standards text (e.g., the IS code PDFs) unless you have explicit rights.
- It’s fine to reference clause numbers and summarize your own calculations/interpretations.
