# Library usability and implementation quality

The owner's goal is a usable library, including improvement of the code already
written. Signatures, examples, and API documentation are part of that goal, not
its limit. Assess the full caller journey and fix confirmed main-process
defects in the current supported workflows. Keep calculation owners, explicit
units, compatibility, and the distinction between software results and
engineering approval intact.

## Work and completion evidence

| Area | Required outcome | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Public Python API | Discoverable typed inputs/results, coherent operations, useful IDE help | Public signatures, type-checked callers, generated reference |
| Implementation | Correct data flow and calculations; no duplicated formula owners or misleading status | Trace each supported workflow through its owner; focused regressions and existing independent benchmarks |
| Intake and results | Consistent structured errors, explicit units/bases, finite reproducible output | Invalid and valid caller journeys, status and serialization evidence |
| Examples and documentation | One recommended entry path; executable recipes for every promoted workflow | Source and installed-wheel replay, documentation build |
| Packaging and interoperability | Clean installation and usable Python/CLI/HTTP boundaries | Installed-wheel and maintained transport journeys |
| Performance and maintainability | Remove confirmed duplication or measured bottlenecks affecting callers | Before/after evidence where a performance claim is made |

Completion requires evidence for the whole table. A facade cleanup or green
test suite alone is insufficient. Existing supported engineering scope is the
starting boundary; adding unsupported structural systems or publishing a new
release is a separate decision.

## Current work

- Baseline: `244a2dae76b253e6c8abd99e5af5329d5b1e0bef`.
- Confirmed: nine family builders expose `Any` groups, ten family modules have
  undocumented operations, and the API-level guide still recommends a different
  namespace from the package README. Slab routes lack equivalent typed builders.
- Batch 1 implemented: typed group imports for all family facades, three slab
  builders, specific calculation result types, complete operation documentation,
  a typed beam/column/slab example, and a purpose-based API chooser. Engineering
  formulas and wire schemas remain unchanged.
- Verification: 70 focused tests pass; 15 implementation/example files pass
  type checking; the strict documentation build passes and rendered family API
  content was inspected. All 13 family recipes and the new typed example pass
  from the built wheel with installed origin verified. Eight additional
  advertised examples execute successfully in isolated scratch directories.
- Remaining canonical operation documentation debt is zero in the generated
  classification. Batch 1 merged as PR #1006 after required validation passed.
- Batch 2 addresses implementation behavior: optional DXF/report imports no
  longer run during calculation or CLI discovery startup. Output functions and
  their missing-dependency behavior retain their existing owners.
- Local timing: seven fresh interpreter processes per entry point on this Mac,
  same Python environment and warmed filesystem. Median package import dropped
  from 588.2 ms to 462.0 ms (21.4%); column import dropped from 576.6 ms to
  460.2 ms (20.2%). These are startup measurements, not calculation-throughput
  or cold-machine claims. The regression checks assert dependency isolation,
  rather than a timing threshold that varies by machine.
- A concrete data-loss defect was reproduced in the Excel bridge's JSON
  round-trip: exported `D=550, d=492, cover=40` reloaded with `d=510`. The
  exporter now includes the loader's explicit `eff_d` field and retains `d`
  for existing JSON consumers. Legacy lowercase overall-depth input remains
  supported. The file round-trip regression uses a supplied depth that differs
  from the default and compares the complete restored record.
- Batch 2 verification: 272 focused import/API compatibility, CLI, Excel bridge,
  DXF, and report checks pass; the three changed library modules pass type
  checking. Regenerated API inventories have no changes. Hosted checks and
  integration remain attached to its PR.
- Next: trace calculation/result and transport paths for outcome-changing
  implementation defects; replay and repair the broader installed user journey.

Use several cohesive commits and one PR per integrated batch. Focused checks
run after the batch; required hosted checks run on its published head.
