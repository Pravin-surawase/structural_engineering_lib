# Library usability and implementation quality

The owner's goal is a usable library, including improvement of the code already
written. Signatures, examples, and API documentation are part of that goal, not
its limit. Assess the full caller journey and fix confirmed main-process
defects in the current supported workflows. Keep calculation owners, explicit
units, compatibility, and the distinction between software results and
engineering approval intact.

## Work and completion evidence

| Area | Required outcome | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Public Python API | Discoverable typed inputs/results, coherent operations, useful IDE help | Public signatures, type-checked callers, generated reference |
| Implementation | Correct data flow and calculations; no duplicated formula owners or misleading status | Trace each supported workflow through its owner; focused regressions and existing independent benchmarks |
| Intake and results | Consistent structured errors, explicit units/bases, finite reproducible output | Invalid and valid caller journeys, status and serialization evidence |
| Examples and documentation | One recommended entry path; executable recipes for every promoted workflow | Source and installed-wheel replay, documentation build |
| Packaging and interoperability | Clean installation and usable Python/CLI/HTTP boundaries | Installed-wheel and maintained transport journeys |
| Performance and maintainability | Remove confirmed duplication or measured bottlenecks affecting callers | Before/after evidence where a performance claim is made |

Completion requires evidence for the whole table. A facade cleanup or green
test suite alone is insufficient. Existing supported engineering scope is the
starting boundary; adding unsupported structural systems or publishing a new
release is a separate decision.

## Current work

- Baseline: `244a2dae76b253e6c8abd99e5af5329d5b1e0bef`.
- Confirmed: nine family builders expose `Any` groups, ten family modules have
  undocumented operations, and the API-level guide still recommends a different
  namespace from the package README. Slab routes lack equivalent typed builders.
- Batch 1 implemented: typed group imports for all family facades, three slab
  builders, specific calculation result types, complete operation documentation,
  a typed beam/column/slab example, and a purpose-based API chooser. Engineering
  formulas and wire schemas remain unchanged.
- Verification: 70 focused tests pass; 15 implementation/example files pass
  type checking; the strict documentation build passes and rendered family API
  content was inspected. All 13 family recipes and the new typed example pass
  from the built wheel with installed origin verified. Eight additional
  advertised examples execute successfully in isolated scratch directories.
- Remaining canonical operation documentation debt is zero in the generated
  classification. Batch 1 merged as PR #1006 after required validation passed.
- Batch 2 addresses implementation behavior: optional DXF/report imports no
  longer run during calculation or CLI discovery startup. Output functions and
  their missing-dependency behavior retain their existing owners.
- Local timing: seven fresh interpreter processes per entry point on this Mac,
  same Python environment and warmed filesystem. Median package import dropped
  from 588.2 ms to 462.0 ms (21.4%); column import dropped from 576.6 ms to
  460.2 ms (20.2%). These are startup measurements, not calculation-throughput
  or cold-machine claims. The regression checks assert dependency isolation,
  rather than a timing threshold that varies by machine.
- A concrete data-loss defect was reproduced in the Excel bridge's JSON
  round-trip: exported `D=550, d=492, cover=40` reloaded with `d=510`. The
  exporter now includes the loader's explicit `eff_d` field and retains `d`
  for existing JSON consumers. Legacy lowercase overall-depth input remains
  supported. The file round-trip regression uses a supplied depth that differs
  from the default and compares the complete restored record.
- Batch 2 verification: 272 focused import/API compatibility, CLI, Excel bridge,
  DXF, and report checks pass; the three changed library modules pass type
  checking. Regenerated API inventories have no changes. PR #1007 merged after
  required hosted checks passed.
- Clean-install replay at `eae98738`: a fresh virtual environment containing only
  the wheel and declared Pydantic dependencies runs all 13 positive/negative
  family recipes and the typed workflow example. Imported origin was inside
  that environment; NumPy, ezdxf, Jinja2, and pytest were absent.
- Batch 3 fixes an outcome-changing JSON intake defect: duplicate `vu_kn`
  members silently discarded the first action. A request containing 500 kN
  followed by 75 kN returned PASS even though 500 kN alone fails. One common
  JSON boundary now rejects duplicates with the complete field path, rejects
  non-finite numbers, and exposes syntax/encoding failures as library issues.
- Every supported family has a typed JSON loader, including slab variants and
  supplied beam checks. The canonical CLI and V2 HTTP beam route use the same
  ambiguity check. Cookbooks and the typed example show direct JSON loading.
- Final verification reason: this batch changes the shared input boundary and
  public loader inventory across all supported families. After content freezes,
  run one cumulative Python suite (including the maintained independent family
  benchmarks), strict docs, and installed Python/CLI/API replay. Do not repeat
  those gates for documentation-only evidence updates; repair only affected
  evidence if a confirmed failure changes the candidate.

## Current evidence

The implementation and usability outcomes above have the following current
evidence. The family JSON batch can be delivered after required hosted checks
pass and its reviewed head is merged; those exact head/run/merge facts stay in
GitHub. The wider usability goal remains active for the complete-member caller
journey described below.

| Outcome | Verified evidence |
|---|---|
| Public API and signatures | Typed groups/results across 11 family modules; 14 typed JSON loaders; 15 changed implementation/example files pass mypy; canonical documentation debt is zero |
| Calculation and result flow | Runtime traces of all 13 family journeys reach their registered calculation owners and preserve expected PASS/FAIL/HOLD states; the cumulative Python suite includes existing independent arithmetic, golden-vector, physical-beam, and workflow regressions |
| Intake and errors | JSON request round-trips preserve all 13 request models plus supplied beam bar arrays; duplicate actions, non-finite values, syntax and encoding failures produce structured issues; CLI and HTTP reject ambiguous action values |
| Examples and reference | All 11 advertised examples execute against the installed wheel with only declared dependencies; all 13 family recipes pass; strict documentation build succeeds and rendered JSON-loader references were inspected |
| Packaging and transports | Fresh virtual environment, installed origin verified, no NumPy/ezdxf/Jinja2/pytest; installed CLI PASS, FAIL, and rejected-input cases pass; V1 preserves engineering FAIL and V2 exactly matches Python while rejecting duplicate JSON |
| Performance and maintenance | Measured import improvement and the lossless Excel-bridge JSON fix are integrated in PR #1007; JSON parsing has one shared owner across the family loaders, canonical CLI, and V2 ambiguity check |

Cumulative command:
`./run.sh test --python -q -m 'not slow and not performance' --disable-warnings --durations=5`.
Result: 8,002 passed and 4 skipped. Slow/performance tests were excluded; this is
software evidence for the supported library scope, not installed Windows-host
acceptance. The affected HTTP checks pass (10 tests), and changed-path formatting
and generated API/cookbook checks pass.

The verified wheel has SHA-256
`1f08ab62d54bb36b792de5afaa738109650b5367e3d6e0a66e8dff2b8dcf9af7`.
It is a local source build; no package publication or release was performed.

## Next bounded work

The promoted `structural_lib.beam` project/profile, physical reinforcement,
complete-member, and construction-package workflows have maintained regression
tests, but the advertised examples do not yet demonstrate their composition.
Trace a realistic installed caller through those existing owners, fix confirmed
main-process defects, and provide one executable example with a matching guide.
Preserve execution, applicability, engineering, completeness, and freshness as
separate evidence dimensions; do not turn example metadata into engineering
approval. Acceptance requires the example to run from the installed wheel and
report missing or stale evidence honestly. Use focused checks for changes found
there; the unchanged cumulative suite above does not need another run.

Use several cohesive commits and one PR per integrated batch. Focused checks
run after the batch; required hosted checks run on its published head.
