<!-- HANDOFF:END -->

**Current release:** `v0.23.0` Alpha

**Branch:** `codex/ui-capability-platform`

**Base:** Session 2 began from merged Session 1 commit `49d7780e`

| State | Target | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| **Current** | UIX-001 P0-P15 complete | Merge only after required checks are green |
| **Next** | No active implementation packet | Await the owner-selected task; do not invent a third UIX cleanup session |
| **Held** | Stable/engineering use | Requires cumulative qualified structural-engineering review |

## Required Reading

- [UI experience foundation master plan](ui-experience-foundation-master-plan.md)
- [Session 2 acceptance](../verification/ui-experience-session-2-acceptance.md)
- [Current task board](../TASKS.md)
- [Release policy](../getting-started/releases.md)

## Accepted UIX outcome

Session 1 delivered revision-safe quick/project results, durable project identity,
revision-bound exports, and authoritative 3D inspection. Session 2 delivered one
immutable beam catalogue, thin discovery API, curated schema renderer, one
default-disabled bounded workflow, one generated provider-neutral beam manifest,
canonical workbench routes, and integrated live acceptance.

The final live pass fixed three main-process causes:

- React Strict Mode cancelled the initial quick-design effect while a one-shot
  ref prevented its replacement; the hook now retains the current runner.
- Catalogue inputs were rendered beside the legacy input surface; catalogue and
  manual modes now have mutually exclusive ownership.
- Project route guards redirected before IndexedDB hydration began; idle/loading
  are now explicit restore states.

The bundled sample settles 153/153 PASS and restores canonical results directly.
Safe, unsafe, stale/recalculate, export, bounded workflow, legacy redirects,
390/1024/1440 px, and WebGL interruption flows pass in maintained Chromium.

## Verification

- 91 focused Python/FastAPI tests, 87 focused React tests, and 76 focused
  geometry/streaming tests pass.
- React/API signature scan matches 29 maintained call sites.
- `./run.sh frontend check` passes lint, 239 tests, and production build.
- `./run.sh check --quick` passes 10/10 and the final integrated gate passes
  30/30; pull-request checks remain the merge authority.

## Holds

- Workflow execution remains unavailable by default and is enabled only through
  explicit development/test flags.
- Firefox, exact Safari responsive automation, GitHub Pages, public workflow
  activation, release/tag/package publication, and professional-use claims are
  not part of UIX acceptance.
- Production JWT secret provisioning remains an owner operation.
- PR #711 remains superseded; PR #683 belongs to a coordinated ESLint 10
  migration; PR #684 remains blocked on a coordinated Vite 8 migration.

## Repeat-prevention record

Every session must record observed issue, confirmed root cause, resolution, and
verification in the newest `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` block. Shared `AGENTS.md` and
agent templates enforce that schema, and session closeout validates the newest
entry only. Log terminal/tool failures with the maintained command or evidence
path that succeeded; do not treat an observer limitation as a product failure.
