# Next Session Briefing

## Latest Handoff (auto)

<!-- HANDOFF:START -->
- Date: 2026-09-05
- Focus: Check whether the existing React geometry workflow can support the whole-model capture discussion. Source review only; preserve findings without changing product code or treating a proposed acquisition sequence as approved.
- Completed: Traced imported endpoints through `useCSVImport.ts`, `importAdapter.ts`, `buildGeometrySpaceV1`, `Viewport3D` and `BuildingScene`. The current viewer builds rectangular member meshes in memory, with explicit coordinate conversion, source identities, revision tracking, filtering and selection.; Confirmed separate reusable rebar/stirrup renderers and the Python geometry service. The building API/hook also exists, but the active building viewport constructs its renderer contract locally rather than calling that hook.; Identified the future integration boundaries: the beam-row import hardcodes beam classification; neighbour detail uses a 0.1 m endpoint-proximity rule; the renderer contract lacks source joint identities, support faces, insertion offsets and complete section axes. Reinforcement previews regenerate from area inputs and defaults, so they cannot establish actual issued bar lengths. Reuse the presentation components with a source-backed model projection; keep authoritative topology and detailing in the engineering services.
- Recurrence controls: RR-005 x42 / unknown: Use maintained launchers, literal PowerShell blocks, exact paths, native output tools, and one shell per operation.; RR-017 x2 / unknown: Inspect configured refspecs and fetch exact required existing refs; preserve configuration and branches unless cleanup is separately authorized.

## Current boundary

[Structural Library Definition Programme PF0–PF11](xll-product/library-definition/README.md)
remains the implementation authority. IMP-M1 implements WP01–WP08 as native
Python and .NET libraries, and IMP-M2 completes the standalone Windows Excel
product in WP09. WP10-01 freezes AO16, WP10-02 adds the exact getter port, and
WP10-03 adds bounded operation control and WP10-04 adds offline normalization;
the next packet is WP10-05 transactional Excel import. Its reviewed executable
card now separates installed Excel proof from later production acquisition
handoff, multi-member support and final paired qualification.

| State | Next action / claim boundary |
|---|---|
| **Current** | WP10-04 normalizes the unchanged retained WP10-03 artifact to 97 model records plus 13 action rows, with all getter evidence retained and Python/.NET canonical parity. Its [receipt](../verification/wp10-04-normalization-evidence.json) records offline proof; inspect the exact PR and delivery ledger for subsequent delivery facts. |
| **Next** | Implement WP10-05 from its [reviewed plan card](xll-product/wp10-etabs-read-adapter.md#wp10-05-preparation-review-and-executable-plan--2026-09-05): bounded chunked storage, explicit source binding, shared transaction, cache invalidation and actual Excel save/reopen/rollback. Preserve cardinal insertion and separate modifiers; import readiness does not establish design readiness or live freshness. The new XLL must be installed/preflighted; earlier WP09 cleanup removed its test installation. WP10-05 implementation has not started. |
| **Then** | WP10-05B supplies the missing production acquisition/file handoff; WP10-05C supplies a compatible multi-member profile and real PF9 dataset manifests. WP10-06 qualifies the integrated path only after those prerequisites; a single-member capture does not prove the 100/1,000-member workloads. |
| Definition boundary | PF0–PF11 remains the approved requirements, semantics, signature, assurance, application, packaging, migration and implementation-order authority. |
| Application boundary | Excel and ETABS remain adapters. Worksheet calculations consume immutable validated data; live COM and mutations are explicit application commands. |
| Implementation boundary | WP10-01 is pure offline validation, WP10-02 is the exact getter-only host boundary, and WP10-03 is the bounded acquisition-control boundary. WP10-04 adds offline projection and normalization without COM or Excel. The pure analysis package must not depend on the optional ETABS assembly. |
| Release boundary | Package publication and GitHub releases retain the repository's separate per-release authorization and evidence process. |

## Implementation order

1. IMP-M1: WP01–WP08 pure dual-language libraries are implemented and qualified.
2. IMP-M2: WP09 now delivers the standalone Excel XLL, workbook and installed
   evidence.
3. IMP-M3: WP10–WP12 deliver getter-only ETABS intake, copied-model reanalysis,
   migration, performance and release readiness.
