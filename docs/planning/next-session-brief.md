# Next Session Briefing

## Latest Handoff (auto)

<!-- HANDOFF:START -->
- Date: 2026-09-05
- Focus: Refine the owner's capture, local model, design/search, ETABS reanalysis and savings workflow before implementing the next product packet.
- Completed: Reviewed PF8/PF11 coupling and transaction contracts, current native solver and candidate-ranking source, WP10 capture boundaries and PF9 performance workloads. Checked CSI's official final-size analysis/design and locking guidance. No Excel or ETABS action was performed in this planning task.; Wrote etabs-design-workflow.md: acquire required broad context once per revision, filter in C# memory, preserve heavy snapshots outside worksheets, use fast local search followed by bounded ETABS copy reanalysis, and retain a fixed baseline for comparable savings. Clarified scope, stop/recovery states, actual-bar quantity requirements and implementation exit conditions.; Linked the refinement from current-plan, UI review and WP10 preparation. The ribbon remains the entry point; small summaries are optional and heavy model/joint/force data do not become worksheets. Product code is unchanged.

## Current boundary

[Structural Library Definition Programme PF0–PF11](xll-product/library-definition/README.md)
remains the implementation authority. IMP-M1 implements WP01–WP08 as native
Python and .NET libraries, and IMP-M2 completes the standalone Windows Excel
product in WP09. WP10-01 freezes AO16, WP10-02 adds the exact getter port, and
WP10-03 adds bounded operation control and WP10-04 adds offline normalization;
the next packet is WP10-05 transactional Excel import. Its reviewed executable
card now separates installed Excel proof from later production acquisition
handoff, multi-member support and final paired qualification.

| State | Next action / claim boundary |
|---|---|
| **Current** | WP10-04 normalizes the unchanged retained WP10-03 artifact to 97 model records plus 13 action rows, with all getter evidence retained and Python/.NET canonical parity. Its [receipt](../verification/wp10-04-normalization-evidence.json) records offline proof; inspect the exact PR and delivery ledger for subsequent delivery facts. |
| **Next** | Implement WP10-05 from its [reviewed plan card](xll-product/wp10-etabs-read-adapter.md#wp10-05-preparation-review-and-executable-plan--2026-09-05): bounded chunked storage, explicit source binding, shared transaction, cache invalidation and actual Excel save/reopen/rollback. Preserve cardinal insertion and separate modifiers; import readiness does not establish design readiness or live freshness. The new XLL must be installed/preflighted; earlier WP09 cleanup removed its test installation. WP10-05 implementation has not started. |
| **Then** | WP10-05B supplies the missing production acquisition/file handoff; WP10-05C supplies a compatible multi-member profile and real PF9 dataset manifests. WP10-06 qualifies the integrated path only after those prerequisites; a single-member capture does not prove the 100/1,000-member workloads. |
| Definition boundary | PF0–PF11 remains the approved requirements, semantics, signature, assurance, application, packaging, migration and implementation-order authority. |
| Application boundary | Excel and ETABS remain adapters. Worksheet calculations consume immutable validated data; live COM and mutations are explicit application commands. |
| Implementation boundary | WP10-01 is pure offline validation, WP10-02 is the exact getter-only host boundary, and WP10-03 is the bounded acquisition-control boundary. WP10-04 adds offline projection and normalization without COM or Excel. The pure analysis package must not depend on the optional ETABS assembly. |
| Release boundary | Package publication and GitHub releases retain the repository's separate per-release authorization and evidence process. |

## Implementation order

1. IMP-M1: WP01–WP08 pure dual-language libraries are implemented and qualified.
2. IMP-M2: WP09 now delivers the standalone Excel XLL, workbook and installed
   evidence.
3. IMP-M3: WP10–WP12 deliver getter-only ETABS intake, copied-model reanalysis,
   migration, performance and release readiness.
