# Next Session Briefing

## Latest Handoff (auto)

<!-- HANDOFF:START -->
- Date: 2026-11-07
- Focus: Packet E is planned in five implementation units; start E1 by freezing the physical T profile, service basis and independent references. Planning only so far; Goal 5 waits for implemented and qualified E.
- Completed: Goals 1–4 and closure Packets A–C; D1/D2 physical torsion plus the selected D3 transient service case. All 31 obligations qualify for that documented model; missing/unsupported service histories remain HOLD and engineering approval remains separate.
- Recurrence controls: None encountered in S5. Historical RR-004 x36 remains unchanged.

## Current boundary

| Release | Current state |
|---|---|
| **Current** | 0.26.0 is published and verified in the [release ledger](../getting-started/releases.md#v0260-published-and-verified). |
| **Next** | 0.27.0 includes the section, column and selected torsion-member work. Complete Packet E, the sagging T-beam member, then qualify the exact versioned candidate. |


Goal 1 froze and replayed the
[four section references](../verification/library-027-comparator-reference.md).
Goal 2 delivered the [beam comparison guide and example](../cookbook/python/beam-comparator-reference.md).
All 21 numerical outputs and both method identifiers passed using the
installed 0.26.0 wheel. The separate doubly reinforced member check returned HOLD.

Goal 3 delivered the layered rectangular section API and verified the
900 mm case and `xu = D` boundary. The example runs both depths and the
result keeps member and detailing acceptance unevaluated.
[Layered column guide](../cookbook/python/layered-column-section.md)

Goal 4 reconciled the single-layer and multilayer member examples across
JSON, BBS, and HTML. The supplied-beam controls recorded missing support
as HOLD and depth mismatch and insufficient steel as FAIL. Both full
member overload replays produced draft artifacts.
[Member guide and replay](../cookbook/python/ordinary-beam-member.md)

The owner selected beam and column closure for 0.27 and slabs and footings
for 0.28. Packet A qualified layered column sections with partial
compression and mixed diameters. Packet B qualified supplied inclined and
bent-up shear reinforcement and sagging flexure within the flange and in
the web. Packet C adds the physical four-corner column, independent x/y
benchmarks and matching JSON/HTML with overload, inadequate-tie and
missing-tie controls. Packet D1 corrects the torsion station basis. The
[D2 worked profile](../cookbook/python/physical-torsion-member.md) now supplies
physical load path, both-face direct tension anchorage, cage/hooks and draft
outputs. Its receiver boundary is section flexure/shear; bearing/contact,
receiver connections and foundations remain with the supporting-system owner.
D3 now adds its independently frozen transient service basis: permanent
G5 concentric, imposed Q3 at400/3mm, immediate after-finishes assessment,
supplementary cracked torsional stiffness, code edge-deflection limits and
indirect service stress/detail crack control. The full31-leaf case produces
issue_ready outputs; the original D2-only command remains HOLD. Nonzero
permanent torque, finite imposed duration and missing/asymmetric boundary
evidence remain HOLD. Follow the guide's actual source and model boundaries.
Complete E before
[LIB-13](https://pravinsurawase.atlassian.net/browse/LIB-13) prepares
the versioned candidate.
[Closure plan](library-usability-improvement.md#beam-and-column-closure-before-goal-5)

The [detailed Packet E plan](library-usability-improvement.md#packet-e-implementation-plan--ordinary-sagging-t-beam-member)
orders E1 profile/references, E2 actual T containment and web cage, E3 full
member/SLS/detail checks, E4 matching outputs and E5 installed qualification.
Keep physical/effective flange widths and web width distinct. The current
physical geometry/path envelopes are rectangular and the ordinary hook
binding expects four longitudinal bars; the proposed six-bar T cage requires
explicit qualification. No Packet E calculation code or frozen numerical
member reference has been delivered by the planning update.

## Required Reading

For Python work, start with the [API chooser](../reference/api-levels.md),
[executable examples](../../Python/examples/README.md), and
[completed usability scope](library-usability-improvement.md).
For installed Excel/ETABS work, use the
[WP10 plan](xll-product/wp10-etabs-read-adapter.md),
[PF11 blueprint](xll-product/library-definition/pf11/README.md), and
[current XLL plan](xll-product/current-plan.md).
All deliveries follow the [canonical Git workflow](../git-automation/git-workflow-single-source.md).
