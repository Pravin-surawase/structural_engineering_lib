# Next Session Briefing

## Latest Handoff (auto)

<!-- HANDOFF:START -->
- Date: 2026-09-05
- Focus: Review the owner's Assumptions sheet, memory-only first version, physical-span sizing and simple ribbon as overall product decisions.
- Completed: Reconciled the proposal with PF4 input origins, PF5 result semantics, PF8 coupling and actual CSI meshing/final-size analysis guidance. One bounded reviewer examined span/group sizing and defaults; the parent independently checked the cited source contracts and official CSI pages.; Updated excel-ui-review.md and etabs-design-workflow.md in place: one visible Assumptions sheet; named editable defaults and required project facts; v1 heavy data in memory; historical saved outputs and reacquisition after reopen; section-pair/actual-bar search across physical spans and construction groups. Required checks and copied-model reanalysis remain explicit product behavior.; Reduced the proposed ribbon to Read ETABS, Assumptions, Design & Optimise, Update & Recheck, and Reports. Design validates inputs without an extra Apply button. Updated current-plan and WP10 preparation to remove the earlier durable heavy-data-store prerequisite. Product implementation and installed acceptance remain separate; no Excel/ETABS operation or engineering code changed here.
- Recurrence controls: RR-005 x45 / unknown: Use maintained launchers, literal PowerShell blocks, exact paths, native output tools, and one shell per operation.

## Current boundary

[Structural Library Definition Programme PF0–PF11](xll-product/library-definition/README.md)
remains the implementation authority. IMP-M1 implements WP01–WP08 as native
Python and .NET libraries, and IMP-M2 completes the standalone Windows Excel
product in WP09. WP10-01 freezes AO16, WP10-02 adds the exact getter port, and
WP10-03 adds bounded operation control and WP10-04 adds offline normalization;
the next packet is WP10-05 transactional Excel import. Its reviewed executable
card now separates installed Excel proof from later production acquisition
handoff, multi-member support and final paired qualification.

| State | Next action / claim boundary |
|---|---|
| **Current** | WP10-04 normalizes the unchanged retained WP10-03 artifact to 97 model records plus 13 action rows, with all getter evidence retained and Python/.NET canonical parity. Its [receipt](../verification/wp10-04-normalization-evidence.json) records offline proof; inspect the exact PR and delivery ledger for subsequent delivery facts. |
| **Next** | Implement WP10-05 from its [reviewed plan card](xll-product/wp10-etabs-read-adapter.md#wp10-05-preparation-review-and-executable-plan--2026-09-05): bounded chunked storage, explicit source binding, shared transaction, cache invalidation and actual Excel save/reopen/rollback. Preserve cardinal insertion and separate modifiers; import readiness does not establish design readiness or live freshness. The new XLL must be installed/preflighted; earlier WP09 cleanup removed its test installation. WP10-05 implementation has not started. |
| **Then** | WP10-05B supplies the missing production acquisition/file handoff; WP10-05C supplies a compatible multi-member profile and real PF9 dataset manifests. WP10-06 qualifies the integrated path only after those prerequisites; a single-member capture does not prove the 100/1,000-member workloads. |
| Definition boundary | PF0–PF11 remains the approved requirements, semantics, signature, assurance, application, packaging, migration and implementation-order authority. |
| Application boundary | Excel and ETABS remain adapters. Worksheet calculations consume immutable validated data; live COM and mutations are explicit application commands. |
| Implementation boundary | WP10-01 is pure offline validation, WP10-02 is the exact getter-only host boundary, and WP10-03 is the bounded acquisition-control boundary. WP10-04 adds offline projection and normalization without COM or Excel. The pure analysis package must not depend on the optional ETABS assembly. |
| Release boundary | Package publication and GitHub releases retain the repository's separate per-release authorization and evidence process. |

## Implementation order

1. IMP-M1: WP01–WP08 pure dual-language libraries are implemented and qualified.
2. IMP-M2: WP09 now delivers the standalone Excel XLL, workbook and installed
   evidence.
3. IMP-M3: WP10–WP12 deliver getter-only ETABS intake, copied-model reanalysis,
   migration, performance and release readiness.
