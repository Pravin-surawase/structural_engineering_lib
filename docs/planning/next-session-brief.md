# Next Session Briefing

## Latest Handoff (auto)

<!-- HANDOFF:START -->
- Date: 2026-11-07
- Focus: Verify the D3 serviceability basis after D2 physical/ULS closure. Keep full torsion-member admission HOLD; Packet E and Goal 5 remain pending.
- Completed: Goals 1–4 and closure Packets A–C merged. D1 corrects corner geometry; D2 adds signed support/crosshead transfer, actual cage/path hooks, full tension anchorage, continuity, durability and draft outputs. Full Packet D remains open through D3.
- Recurrence controls: None encountered in S5. Historical RR-004 x36 remains unchanged.

## Current boundary

| Release | Current state |
|---|---|
| **Current** | 0.26.0 is published and verified in the [release ledger](../getting-started/releases.md#v0260-published-and-verified). |
| **Next** | 0.27.0 includes the merged section work and Packet C. Complete the rectangular torsion and sagging T-beam member packets, then qualify the versioned candidate. |


Goal 1 froze and replayed the
[four section references](../verification/library-027-comparator-reference.md).
Goal 2 delivered the [beam comparison guide and example](../cookbook/python/beam-comparator-reference.md).
All 21 numerical outputs and both method identifiers passed using the
installed 0.26.0 wheel. The separate doubly reinforced member check returned HOLD.

Goal 3 delivered the layered rectangular section API and verified the
900 mm case and `xu = D` boundary. The example runs both depths and the
result keeps member and detailing acceptance unevaluated.
[Layered column guide](../cookbook/python/layered-column-section.md)

Goal 4 reconciled the single-layer and multilayer member examples across
JSON, BBS, and HTML. The supplied-beam controls recorded missing support
as HOLD and depth mismatch and insufficient steel as FAIL. Both full
member overload replays produced draft artifacts.
[Member guide and replay](../cookbook/python/ordinary-beam-member.md)

The owner selected beam and column closure for 0.27 and slabs and footings
for 0.28. Packet A qualified layered column sections with partial
compression and mixed diameters. Packet B qualified supplied inclined and
bent-up shear reinforcement and sagging flexure within the flange and in
the web. Packet C adds the physical four-corner column, independent x/y
benchmarks and matching JSON/HTML with overload, inadequate-tie and
missing-tie controls. Packet D1 corrects the torsion station basis. Continue
the [D2 worked profile](../cookbook/python/physical-torsion-member.md) for
physical load path, both-face direct tension anchorage, cage/hooks and draft
outputs. Its receiver boundary is section flexure/shear; bearing/contact,
receiver connections and foundations remain with the supporting-system owner.
D3 serviceability remains HOLD until its basis is independently verified.
Full torsion member admission remains HOLD.
Complete D and E before
[LIB-13](https://pravinsurawase.atlassian.net/browse/LIB-13) prepares
the versioned candidate.

## Required Reading

For Python work, start with the [API chooser](../reference/api-levels.md),
[executable examples](../../Python/examples/README.md), and
[completed usability scope](library-usability-improvement.md).
For installed Excel/ETABS work, use the
[WP10 plan](xll-product/wp10-etabs-read-adapter.md),
[PF11 blueprint](xll-product/library-definition/pf11/README.md), and
[current XLL plan](xll-product/current-plan.md).
All deliveries follow the [canonical Git workflow](../git-automation/git-workflow-single-source.md).
