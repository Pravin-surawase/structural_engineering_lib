# Research Index

This index helps you find the right research document quickly. Start with the methodology doc if you are new to the research set.

## How to use this index

- Read `RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.md` first if you are creating or reviewing research.
- Use the tags to find the closest match to your task.
- Each entry includes a "when to read" hint so you can avoid unnecessary context.
