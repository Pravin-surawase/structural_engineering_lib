## 🎯 DECISION NEEDED FROM YOU

**Pick 1-2 ideas that excite you:**

```
Option A: Start with IDEA #1 (Pareto Optimization)
  → Feasible, practical, ships quickly
  → Less research novelty, more engineering
  → Good fit for immediate impact

Option B: Start with IDEA #2 (Probabilistic Design)
  → High research novelty, regulatory future
  → Completes your library (gap in serviceability)
  → Medium difficulty, publishable

Option C: Start with IDEA #3 (AI for Design)
  → Highest research novelty + market appeal
  → Frontier research, potential game-changer
  → Harder, longer timeline, could be PhD-level work

Option D: Start with IDEA #4 (Durability Prediction)
  → India-specific problem
  → Practical value (saves on maintenance)
  → Good data collection opportunity

Option E: Start with IDEA #5 (Seismic Fragility)
  → India-specific problem (seismic zones)
  → High research novelty
  → Computational intensity, but manageable

Option F: Start with IDEA #6 (Digital Twins)
  → Highest ambition, 5-10 year vision
  → Combines multiple technologies
  → Could be consulting + research combo

Option G: Combination (e.g., #1 + #3)
  → Start with quick win (Pareto)
  → Follow with big research (AI)
  → Balanced approach

Option H: Something entirely different
  → Tell me what you're thinking
  → We can explore together
