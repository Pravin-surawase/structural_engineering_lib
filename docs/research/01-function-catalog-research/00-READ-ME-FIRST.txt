## 💡 Key Takeaways

### The Library Does ONE Thing
```
Beam dimensions + loads
    → IS 456 rules applied
    → Required steel output
```

### Three Layers (Remember This!)
1. **Core:** Pure math (flexure.py, shear.py)
2. **App:** Coordination (pipeline.py, job_runner.py)
3. **UI:** User interface (CLI, Excel, Python)

### Main Functions You'll Use
```python
flexure.design_singly_reinforced()      # How much steel?
shear.design_shear()                    # What spacing?
detailing.decide_bar_arrangement()      # Which bars?
```

### Units (CRITICAL!)
- Dimensions: **mm**
- Stresses: **N/mm²**
- Moments: **kN·m**
- Forces: **kN**
