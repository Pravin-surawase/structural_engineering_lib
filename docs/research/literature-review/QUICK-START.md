# 200-Paper Literature Review: Quick Start Guide

**🚀 Start Here!** This is your entry point for the 3-week systematic literature review.

## What Are You Doing?

You're reading **~200 academic papers** across 3 weeks to:
- **Understand** Pareto optimization in structural design
- **Research** best visualization practices for trade-offs
- **Study** carbon footprint and design automation
- **Identify** gaps in existing literature
- **Position** your research uniquely in the landscape

**Output:** By Feb 10, you'll have research-grounded insights to guide implementation.

## Your 3-Week Mission (Jan 13 - Feb 3)

| Week | Papers | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | 70 | Pareto optimization & multi-objective design | `week-1/KEY-FINDINGS.md` |
| **2** | 70 | Visualization & decision support systems | `week-2/KEY-FINDINGS.md` |
| **3** | 60 | Carbon footprint & design automation | `week-3/KEY-FINDINGS.md` |
| **4** | — | Synthesis & positioning (Feb 3-10) | `SYNTHESIS-AND-GAPS.md` + 3 others |

---

## How to Succeed

### Daily Routine (2-3 hours/day)

**Morning (30 min):**
1. Open `SEARCH-STRATEGY.md`
2. Pick today's phase (e.g., Phase 1.1 = Pareto theory)
3. Find 5-8 papers using provided search queries
4. Record in `PAPER-TRACKER.csv` with status `📌 To Read`

**Afternoon/Evening (90-120 min):**
1. Read papers in depth (10-20 min each)
2. Write 1-paragraph summary per paper
3. Update PAPER-TRACKER.csv: mark `✅ Read`
4. Add key insights to `KEY-FINDINGS.md`

**Sunday (30 min):**
1. Review the week's KEY-FINDINGS.md
2. Consolidate patterns observed
3. Plan next week's searches

### Pace

- **Target:** 5-8 papers/day during work week (Mon-Fri)
- **Weekly capacity:** 25-40 papers/week
- **Weeks 1-3:** 70+70+60 = 200 papers total ✅

## Start RIGHT NOW (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Orient Yourself
✅ You just skimmed this file. You're oriented.

### Step 2: Gather Your Tools
- Open `SEARCH-STRATEGY.md` in a text editor
- Open `PAPER-TRACKER.csv` (use Excel, Google Sheets, or text)
- Create a folder for PDFs (optional): `_papers/`
- Have Google Scholar open: https://scholar.google.com

### Step 3: Find Your First Papers (Today!)

**Phase 1.1 — Pareto Theory (Jan 13-14, target 15 papers)**

Open `SEARCH-STRATEGY.md` and use these search queries:
- Google Scholar: `pareto frontier optimization`
- Google Scholar: `pareto optimality design`
- IEEE Xplore: `NSGA-II genetic algorithm`
- Google Scholar: `multi-objective optimization structural design`

Find **5-7 papers** today. Record each in `PAPER-TRACKER.csv`:
- Column A (ID): `P1-001`, `P1-002`, etc.
- Column B (Status): `📌 To Read`
- Column C-J: Title, Authors, Year, Journal, URL, etc.

### Step 4: Read Tonight
Pick 2-3 papers from your list. Read abstracts + key sections (not cover-to-cover).
Write 1 paragraph summary per paper. Record in `week-1-pareto-optimization/00-PAPERS-SUMMARY.md`.

### Step 5: Capture Insights
Add any key insights to `week-1-pareto-optimization/KEY-FINDINGS.md`:
- "Pareto fronts should have X-Y dimensions for clarity"
- "NSGA-II is superior to X because..."
- Questions for next papers: "Does anyone do this for concrete design?"

**Done for today!** Continue with 5-8 papers/day Mon-Fri.
