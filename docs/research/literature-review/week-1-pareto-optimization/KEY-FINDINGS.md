## Key Questions for Week 2

Based on Week 1 research, these questions will guide Week 2:

1. **Visualization Challenge:** How should we visualize 3-4 competing objectives for engineers?
2. **Interaction Patterns:** What interaction patterns help engineers explore Pareto trade-offs?
3. **Color & Perception:** How do engineers perceive trade-off information? (Color? Shape? Position?)
4. **Decision Support:** What additional information helps engineers make choices?
5. **Tool Usability:** What barriers prevent adoption of MOO-based design tools?
