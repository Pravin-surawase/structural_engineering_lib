## 2025-12-31

### Actions
- Created claim ledger for top public-facing assertions.
- Prioritized verification queue (C-001, C-003, C-010, C-004/C-005, C-008).
- Ran an initial source verification pass for public case studies and BDAS/BCA wording.

### Sources to verify (initial list)
- Maplesoft blog on spreadsheet errors (secondary; locate original study).
- ResearchGate thread on ETABS API startup reliability (anecdotal; seek corroboration).
- BCA Singapore buildability page + academic BDAS papers (confirm any 7-10% savings).
- Product survey notes for "no product offers sensitivity analysis in Excel" (scope + date).
- Internal test logs for golden vectors (exact sample size + wording).

### Notes
- Existing findings stay unchanged until verification completes.
- Any claim without primary support will be reworded as anecdotal or scope-limited.
- Added `docs/publications/findings/05-source-verification-notes.md` with initial sources and gaps.
