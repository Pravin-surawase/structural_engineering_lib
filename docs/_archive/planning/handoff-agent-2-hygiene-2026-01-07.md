## Key Findings

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

1. **Broken Documentation Navigation**
   - 5 critical broken links blocking documentation usability
   - Missing files: `ai-enhancements.md`, `detailing-research.md`, `LICENSE_ENGINEERING.md`
   - Wrong paths in v0.17-task-specs.md, api-design-guidelines.md

2. **Git Hygiene**
   - Root `.coverage` file tracked (should only be in Python/)
   - MyPy cache not in .gitignore (risk of accidental commit)

3. **Inconsistent Repository Standards**
   - 30+ files violate naming conventions (UPPERCASE vs kebab-case)
   - Difficult to navigate, unprofessional appearance

### Medium-Priority Findings

4. **Worktrees Need Review**
   - `worktree-2026-01-07T07-28-08`: Clean but not merged
   - `worktree-2026-01-07T08-14-04`: Has staged file, not merged
   - Both pushed to origin but may be obsolete

5. **File Duplication Overhead**
   - Maintaining 2 LICENSE files (question: PyPI distribution need?)
   - Maintaining 2 SUPPORT.md files (agents/ copy unnecessary)

6. **README Proliferation**
   - 28 README files (some may be redundant)
   - Pytest cache READMEs tracked (should ignore)

### Long-Term Improvements

7. **Repository Organization**
   - docs/ root has 30+ files (cluttered)
   - Proposed: Move to guides/, overview/, releases/ subdirs

8. **Historical Content**
   - v0.7-v0.12 planning docs still active (should archive)
   - TASK-210/211 session docs (completed, should archive)

---

## Decision Points for MAIN

### Immediate Decisions Required

1. **Python/LICENSE file:**
   - ❓ Keep for PyPI distribution? (legal requirement?)
   - ❓ Replace with stub pointing to root?
   - **Recommendation:** Check PyPI packaging requirements first

2. **Worktrees (2 potentially stale):**
   - ❓ Are worktree-2026-01-07T07-28-08 and T08-14-04 still needed?
   - ❓ Merge branches first, then remove?
   - ❓ Or remove directly (work complete)?
   - **Recommendation:** Check branch content before decision

3. **File Naming Strategy:**
   - ❓ Prioritize which phase? (root docs first recommended)
   - ❓ Do all 30+ files at once or incrementally?
   - **Recommendation:** Phase 1 (root docs) first - highest visibility

### Strategic Decisions

4. **Documentation Restructuring:**
   - ❓ Worth 3-4 hours to reorganize docs/ structure?
   - ❓ Or just focus on archiving obsolete content?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with archival (easier), restructure later

5. **README Consolidation:**
   - ❓ Which READMEs are truly redundant?
   - ❓ Audit manually or keep all as directory indexes?
   - **Recommendation:** Audit work-in-progress and research READMEs first

## Suggested Implementation Order

If implementing P0 + P1 issues:

### Week 1: Critical Fixes (4-5 hours)
```
Day 1-2:
✅ ISSUE-001: Fix 5 critical broken links (1h)
✅ ISSUE-002: Remove root .coverage (15min)
✅ ISSUE-003: Verify mypy cache not tracked (10min)
✅ ISSUE-006: Investigate worktrees (re-check count) (1h)
✅ ISSUE-005: Consolidate LICENSE/SUPPORT (30min)
```

### Week 2: High-Priority Naming (4-6 hours)
```
Day 3-4:
✅ ISSUE-004 Phase 1: Rename root docs/ files (2-3h)
✅ ISSUE-004 Phase 2: Rename _internal/ files (1-2h)
✅ Verify: Run check_links.py after each phase
```

### Week 3: README Audit (2-3 hours)
```
Day 5:
✅ ISSUE-007: Audit 28 READMEs (2-3h)
✅ Remove pytest cache READMEs from tracking
✅ Consolidate redundant READMEs
```

---

## Implementation Options for MAIN

### Option A: Assign Back to Agent 2 (Mode 2)
**Process:**
1. MAIN approves specific issues (e.g., "Fix P0 only")
2. Agent 2 switches to Mode 2 (Implementation)
3. Agent 2 creates `hygiene/cleanup-2026-01-07` branch
4. Agent 2 executes fixes, commits locally
5. Agent 2 hands off for MAIN review
6. MAIN pushes and merges if approved

**Pros:**
- ✅ Agent 2 specializes in hygiene (efficiency)
- ✅ MAIN can focus on other tasks
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires handoff coordination
- ⚠️ Agent 2 learning curve on first implementation

### Option B: MAIN Implements Directly
**Process:**
1. MAIN checks out `audit/hygiene-2026-01-07`
2. MAIN reviews audit report
3. MAIN creates implementation branch
4. MAIN follows commands in audit report
5. MAIN pushes and merges

**Pros:**
- ✅ Faster (no handoff)
- ✅ MAIN has full context
- ✅ Can make decisions on-the-fly

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Takes MAIN time away from feature work
- ⚠️ Agent 2 idle (unused capacity)

### Option C: Hybrid (Split Work)
**Process:**
1. MAIN does P0 critical fixes immediately
2. Agent 2 does P1 high-priority in Mode 2
3. Defer P2 to backlog

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Critical fixes fast, bulk work delegated
- ✅ Efficient resource use

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires coordination

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Commands Provided

All issues include copy-paste verification:

```bash
# After fixing broken links
./scripts/check_links.py
# Expected: 0 broken links

# After removing artifacts
git ls-files | grep -E '\.DS_Store|\.coverage|\.pyc'
# Expected: Only Python/.coveragerc

# After renaming files
rg -l "OLD_FILENAME.md"
# Expected: No matches

# After worktree cleanup
git worktree list
# Expected: Only active worktrees

# After .gitignore updates
git status --porcelain | grep -E '^??' | head -5
# Expected: No generated files showing
```

### Safety Checks

Each issue includes:
- ✅ Commands to verify current state
- ✅ Commands to fix issue
- ✅ Commands to verify fix
- ✅ Acceptance criteria checklist

## Files Changed Summary

**Created:**
- ✅ `docs/_archive/planning-completed-2026-03/hygiene-suggestions-2026-01-07.md` (971 lines)

**Branch:**
- ✅ `audit/hygiene-2026-01-07` (1 commit, not pushed)

**Not Modified:**
- ✅ No production code touched
- ✅ No tests modified
- ✅ No CI workflows changed
- ✅ No main branch edits

---

## Next Steps for MAIN

### Step 1: Review Audit Report
```bash
# Switch to audit branch
git checkout audit/hygiene-2026-01-07

# Read full report
cat docs/_archive/planning-completed-2026-03/hygiene-suggestions-2026-01-07.md

# Or open in editor
code docs/_archive/planning-completed-2026-03/hygiene-suggestions-2026-01-07.md
```

### Step 2: Make Decisions
- [ ] Which issues to fix now? (P0 only? P0+P1?)
- [ ] Implementation option? (A: Agent 2, B: MAIN, C: Hybrid)
- [ ] Decision on Python/LICENSE (keep or stub?)
- [ ] Decision on worktrees (merge or remove?)

### Step 3: Execute or Delegate
**If Agent 2 Mode 2:**
```bash
# Command: "Agent 2, implement P0 issues in Mode 2"
# Agent 2 will create hygiene/cleanup-* branch and execute
```

**If MAIN implements:**
```bash
git checkout -b hygiene/fixes-2026-01-07
# Follow commands in audit report for each issue
./scripts/check_links.py  # Verify after each fix
git commit -m "chore: fix hygiene issues P0"
git push origin hygiene/fixes-2026-01-07
# Merge to main
```

### Step 4: Merge Audit Report
```bash
# After decisions made, merge audit report to main
git checkout main
git merge audit/hygiene-2026-01-07
git push origin main
```
