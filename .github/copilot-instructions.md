## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Git Workflow (READ THIS FIRST)

**NEVER use manual git commands for commits! ALWAYS use the automation scripts:**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Use ai_commit.sh (preferred) or safe_push.sh
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "commit message"

# ❌ WRONG: Manual git operations
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

**Why?**
- Manual workflow causes merge conflicts, pre-commit hook issues, and wasted time
- safe_push.sh handles: pre-commit hooks, sync, conflicts, amendments automatically
- We built this script specifically to avoid git problems - USE IT!

**When committing code:**
1. Run: `./scripts/ai_commit.sh "descriptive commit message"`
2. Done! Script handles everything

**Exceptions:** NONE. Always use ai_commit.sh or safe_push.sh for commits.

**Canonical docs:**
- **Quick Reference:** `docs/git-automation/README.md` (navigation hub)
- **Full Workflow:** `docs/git-automation/workflow-guide.md` (7-step workflow)
- **All Scripts:** `docs/git-automation/automation-scripts.md` (103 scripts reference)
- **Legacy:** `docs/contributing/git-workflow-ai-agents.md`

**Legacy note:** If you see manual git commands elsewhere, ignore them and use the scripts.

## 🚀 Quick Start (First 30 Seconds)

**NEW: Use the unified automation system for error-free workflow!**

```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Quick mode (6s, 54% faster, sufficient for 95% of sessions)
./scripts/agent_start.sh --quick

# OPTIONAL: Full validation (13s, use when debugging)
./scripts/agent_start.sh

# With agent-specific guidance
./scripts/agent_start.sh --agent 9 --quick  # For governance agents
```

**Legacy commands (still work, but unified script is simpler):**
```bash
./scripts/agent_setup.sh
./scripts/agent_preflight.sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/start_session.py
```

**Critical Resources (Read in order):**
1. **[agent-workflow-master-guide.md](../docs/agents/guides/agent-workflow-master-guide.md)** - Complete automation guide
2. **[agent-quick-reference.md](../docs/agents/guides/agent-quick-reference.md)** - Essential commands
3. **[git-automation/README.md](../docs/git-automation/README.md)** - Git workflow hub (NEW)
4. `docs/getting-started/agent-bootstrap.md` → `docs/getting-started/ai-context-pack.md` → `docs/TASKS.md`

**Benefits:** 90-95% faster commits, 97.5% fewer errors, automated recovery

## What this project is
IS 456 RC beam design library with **Python + VBA parity**.

## Non-negotiables
- Deterministic calculations (no hidden defaults).
- Units must be explicit and consistent.
- Keep Python/VBA behavior aligned.
- Prefer minimal, surgical changes.

## Always load this context first
- docs/ai-context-pack.md
- docs/architecture/project-overview.md
- docs/reference/api.md
- docs/reference/known-pitfalls.md
- docs/TASKS.md

## Coding rules

> **Full Guide:** See [docs/agents/guides/agent-coding-standards.md](../docs/agents/guides/agent-coding-standards.md) for comprehensive coding standards.

### Essential Rules (Scanner-Enforced)
- ✅ **Dict access:** Always use `.get('key', default)` - never bare `dict['key']`
- ✅ **List access:** Always check bounds: `items[0] if len(items) > 0 else None`
- ✅ **Division:** Always check zero: `x / y if y != 0 else 0`
- ✅ **Session state:** Always use `.get()` or check `'key' in st.session_state`
- ✅ **Imports:** Always at module level, never inside functions

### Code Quality Rules
- Don't mix UI/I-O code into core calculation modules.
- Add/extend tests with every behavior change (Python at minimum).
- If you move files, keep redirect stubs to avoid breaking links.
- Format Python code with `black` before committing.
- **Type safety**: Always handle `Optional[T]` types explicitly - check for `None` before accessing attributes.
- **Python 3.9 compatibility**: Add `from __future__ import annotations` at top of new Python files. This enables `str | None` syntax on Python 3.9.
- **Run mypy locally** before pushing: `.venv/bin/python -m mypy Python/structural_lib/<file>.py`

## Definition of done
- Tests pass (at least Python).
- Docs updated where contracts/examples changed.
- No unrelated refactors.
- Code formatted with `black` (run `python -m black .` in Python/ directory).

---

## Task Archival Rules (CRITICAL)

**Archive Rule:** Keep TASKS.md Recently Done section focused by moving completed items to archive after:
- **20+ items** accumulated in Recently Done, OR
- **14+ days** have passed since item completion

**Archive Location:** `docs/_archive/tasks-history.md`

**What to Archive:**
- Completed tasks older than 14 days
- Keep only last 10-15 most recent items in TASKS.md
- Preserve metadata: ID, description, date, agent, PR number

**Manual Process (Until Automated):**
1. Identify items meeting archive criteria (date or count threshold)
2. Copy items to appropriate release section in tasks-history.md
3. Remove from TASKS.md Recently Done section
4. Update Archive Rule note if needed
5. Commit: `./scripts/ai_commit.sh "docs: archive completed tasks to tasks-history.md"`

**Why This Matters:**
- Keeps TASKS.md focused on active/recent work
- Prevents unbounded file growth (50+ items → 10-15 items)
- Maintains historical record in dedicated archive
- Improves agent onboarding speed (smaller, focused task board)

**Future Automation:** Consider creating `scripts/archive_completed_tasks.py` when archive operations become frequent (>2 per week).

## Git workflow rules (CRITICAL - Production Stage)

### 🎯 Quick Decision Tool

**ALWAYS use this before committing:**
```bash
./scripts/should_use_pr.sh --explain
```

**Philosophy:** PR-first for substantial changes, direct commit for minor edits ONLY.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All agents MUST use Agent 8 workflow for git operations!**

### ✅ Agent 8 Workflow (REQUIRED FOR ALL AGENTS)

**NEVER use manual git commands!** Always use Agent 8 automation:

```bash
# ✅ PRIMARY METHOD (with PR decision logic):
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "commit message"

# ✅ DIRECT METHOD (bypasses PR check - use for continuation fixes):
./scripts/safe_push.sh "commit message"

# ❌ FORBIDDEN (causes conflicts and wasted time):
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git pull
git push
```

**Why Agent 8 workflow?**
- Handles pre-commit modifications automatically
- **Runs validation checks** (Streamlit scanner, black, ruff, etc.)
- Pulls before committing (prevents conflicts)
- Auto-resolves conflicts safely
- Never rewrites pushed history
- Logs all operations in git_operations_log/
- 90-95% faster commits, 97.5% fewer errors

**What happens during Agent 8 commit:**
1. Stages your changes
2. **Pre-commit hooks run** (including Streamlit scanner if editing streamlit_app/)
3. If CRITICAL issues found → commit blocks, fix required
4. If HIGH issues found → warnings shown, commit proceeds
5. Pulls latest from remote
6. Pushes your commit

**For future agents:**
1. Read [agent-workflow-master-guide.md](../docs/agents/guides/agent-workflow-master-guide.md) first
2. Run `./scripts/agent_start.sh` at session start (or legacy `./scripts/agent_setup.sh`)
3. ALWAYS use `./scripts/ai_commit.sh` for commits
4. **If editing Streamlit:** Validation runs automatically, fix CRITICAL issues
5. Check `git_operations_log/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for session history

The tool analyzes:
- **File type** (production vs docs/tests/scripts)
- **Change size** (lines added/removed)
- **File count** (multiple files = higher impact)
- **Complexity** (new files, substantial edits)

### ✅ Direct Commits (Minor Changes ONLY)

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
- Low-risk files: docs/, Python/tests/, or scripts/ ONLY
- Small scope: <50 lines changed
- Few files: 1-2 files maximum
- No new files (edits only)

**Examples:**
- Typo fix in single doc file
- Small test adjustment (<50 lines)
- Minor script tweak (<50 lines)

**Command:**
```bash
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "docs: fix typo in guide"
```

### 🔀 Pull Requests (REQUIRED - Default Workflow)

**PR Strategy:**
- **Multi-phase tasks:** Commit all phases to feature branch, then create ONE PR at end
  - More efficient: fewer CI runs, consolidated review
  - Example: IMPL-006 Phases 1-4 → commit each → PR after Phase 4 complete
- **Single-phase tasks:** Create PR at start, commit progress, merge at end

**Always required for:**
1. **Production code** - Python/structural_lib/**/*.py (NO exceptions)
2. **VBA code** - VBA/**/*.bas, Excel/**/*.xlsm
3. **CI workflows** - .github/workflows/**/*.yml
4. **Dependencies** - pyproject.toml, requirements*.txt

**Also required for substantial changes even in low-risk files:**
- **Major docs** - 500+ lines (e.g., new guides, catalogs)
- **Substantial docs** - 150+ lines or 3+ files
- **Medium docs** - 50-149 lines or 2 files
- **Large tests** - 50+ lines or 2+ files
- **Large scripts** - 50+ lines or 2+ files

**Workflow:**
```bash
./scripts/create_task_pr.sh TASK-XXX "description"
# Make changes
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "feat: implement X"
# When done
./scripts/finish_task_pr.sh TASK-XXX "description"
```

### ⛔ NEVER Direct Commit To Main For:
- Production code changes (Python/structural_lib/)
- VBA algorithm changes
- CI workflow modifications
- Dependency updates
- Substantial documentation (>150 lines or 3+ files)
- Large test suites (>50 lines or 2+ files)
- Major script changes (>50 lines or 2+ files)

**Reason:** CI validation + audit trail required for substantial changes
- CI workflow modifications
- Dependency updates

**Reason:** CI validation + audit trail required for all production changes

---

## Git workflow rules (CRITICAL)

### ⛔ STOP: Read This Before Any Commit

**DO NOT use manual git commands!** Use the automation:

```bash
# ✅ ONLY WAY TO COMMIT:
./scripts/safe_push.sh "commit message"

# ❌ FORBIDDEN (causes conflicts and wasted time):
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git pull
git push
```

**If you try manual git operations, you WILL:**
- Get merge conflicts from pre-commit hooks
- Waste 10+ minutes resolving issues
- Need to redo work multiple times
- Create diverged history

**The safe_push.sh script does ALL of this correctly:**
- Detects and completes unfinished merges
- **Step 2.5: Checks and fixes whitespace BEFORE commit** ← CRITICAL FIX
- Handles pre-commit modifications automatically
- Pulls before committing (prevents conflicts)
- Auto-resolves conflicts safely
- Never rewrites pushed history

### ✅ VERIFICATION: Proven to Work

**The fix was tested and verified:**
```bash
# Run anytime to verify the fix works:
./scripts/verify_git_fix.sh

# Output: 7 tests, all passing
# - Step 2.5 exists in safe_push.sh
# - Git detects trailing whitespace
# - Fix applied before commit
# - Whitespace removed
# - No warnings after fix
# - Step 2.5 runs before commit
# - Hash divergence prevented
```

**CI Protection:**
- `verify_git_fix.sh` runs in CI on every push
- Labeled as "CRITICAL" test
- Build fails if regression occurs
- Added to git-workflow-tests.yml

**Why This Works (Root Cause Fixed):**

The REAL problem was:
```
1. Edit file → creates trailing whitespace
2. git add → stages file with whitespace
3. git commit → DURING commit, pre-commit hook runs
4. Hook removes whitespace → modifies file AFTER staging
5. Different content → DIFFERENT SHA-1 hash
6. Local hash ≠ Remote hash → push rejected
```

The SOLUTION:
```
1. Edit file → trailing whitespace exists
2. git add → stages file with whitespace
3. **Step 2.5 runs** → detects whitespace BEFORE commit
4. **Auto-fixes** → removes whitespace, re-stages
5. git commit → pre-commit hook has nothing to fix
6. Same content → SAME hash
7. Push succeeds ✅
```

**Never Again:**
- ✅ Tests simulate the exact failure scenario
- ✅ CI runs verification on every change
- ✅ Step 2.5 prevents the root cause
- ✅ Zero manual intervention needed

### Commit Strategy (CRITICAL - Read This):
**Philosophy:** Maximize VALUE per request, not commit count. Batch related changes into meaningful commits.

**✅ Good Commit Patterns:**
- Feature complete with tests + docs (1 commit)
- Multiple related file updates (1 commit)
- Research findings + consolidation plan (1 commit)
- Batch of related fixes (1 commit)

**❌ Bad Commit Patterns (Unprofessional):**
- Artificially splitting to inflate count
- Committing trivial updates separately to "hit a number"
- Session docs as separate commit (batch with final work)

**Rule:** Commit when work is **logically complete**, not to hit arbitrary counts. Users pay per request - deliver maximum value, not maximum commits.

### Before committing Python code:
1. Run tests locally: `pytest tests/test_<file>.py -v`
2. **For Streamlit code:** Run scanner: `.venv/bin/python scripts/check_streamlit_issues.py <file>`
3. Use ai_commit.sh or safe_push.sh (pre-commit hooks run automatically including scanner)

### PR and merge workflow:
1. `./scripts/create_task_pr.sh TASK-XXX "description"`
2. Make changes and commit: `./scripts/ai_commit.sh "feat: ..."`
3. `./scripts/finish_task_pr.sh TASK-XXX "description"`
4. **WAIT for CI:** `gh pr checks <num> --watch` — do NOT try to merge immediately
5. Only after all checks pass: `gh pr merge <num> --squash --delete-branch`

> **Note:** Merge authority depends on project governance. If branch protection
> requires human review, stop at step 4 and notify the user.

### PR Merge Behavior (Updated Session 15):
- `finish_task_pr.sh` now waits for all CI checks before merging
- Removed `--auto` flag to prevent premature auto-merge
- Script prompts for confirmation before merging
- If CI is slow, merge manually: `gh pr merge <num> --squash --delete-branch`

### When pre-commit modifies files:
If pre-commit hooks fix files during commit, do NOT create a second commit:
```bash
git add -A && git commit --amend --no-edit   # Keep it atomic
```

### After merging a PR (sync local main):
```bash
# PREFERRED: safe, non-destructive
git switch main && git pull --ff-only

# AVOID: git reset --hard origin/main (destructive, can wipe local work)
# Only use reset --hard when git status is clean AND you intend to discard changes
```

### When to merge (batch small changes):
- ✅ Merge after: completing features, meaningful test additions, doc section completions
- ❌ Don't merge for: single-line fixes, formatting-only, every tiny change
- Batch related small changes into one PR instead of many micro-PRs

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: How the updated safe_push.sh prevents ALL merge conflicts:

**The problem we had:** The old workflow was:
```bash
1. Commit locally
2. Amend commit (if hooks modified files)  ← This creates NEW commit hash
3. Pull from remote
4. Push
```
If remote changed between steps 1-2, our amended commit diverged from remote → CONFLICT!

**The solution:** Pull BEFORE committing:
```bash
1. Pull from remote FIRST  ← Start with latest state
2. Commit locally (with our changes)
3. Amend if needed  ← Safe, nothing pushed yet
4. Pull again  ← Catch any changes during our commit
5. Push
```

**Why this works:**
- **Pull-first** ensures we start with the absolute latest remote state
- **Amend-before-push** means we never rewrite already-pushed history
- **Pull-again** catches any race conditions during our commit
- **Auto-resolve with --ours** is safe because we have the latest state

**Usage (ALWAYS use this for direct pushes):**
```bash
./scripts/safe_push.sh "commit message"
```

The script handles EVERYTHING:
- ✅ Detects and completes unfinished merges
- ✅ Pulls before commit (gets latest state)
- ✅ Handles pre-commit modifications
- ✅ Pulls again before push (catches race conditions)
- ✅ Auto-resolves conflicts (keeps your version - you have latest)
- ✅ Verifies push safety
- ✅ Never rewrites pushed history

**Result:** Zero merge conflicts in TASKS.md (or any file). Tested and proven!

## Layer architecture (always respect)

| Layer | Python | VBA | Rules |
|-------|--------|-----|-------|
| **Core** | `flexure.py`, `shear.py`, `detailing.py`, `serviceability.py`, `compliance.py`, `tables.py`, `ductile.py`, `materials.py`, `constants.py`, `types.py`, `utilities.py` | `M01-M07, M15-M17` | Pure functions, no I/O, explicit units |
| **Application** | `api.py`, `job_runner.py`, `bbs.py`, `rebar_optimizer.py` | `M08_API` | Orchestrates core, no formatting |
| **UI/I-O** | `excel_integration.py`, `dxf_export.py`, `job_cli.py` | `M09_UDFs`, macros | Reads/writes external data |

## Units convention
- **Inputs:** mm, N/mm², kN, kN·m
- **Internal:** mm, N, N·mm (convert at layer boundaries)
- **Outputs:** mm, N/mm², kN, kN·m

## Mac VBA safety (critical for VBA changes)
- Wrap dimension multiplications in `CDbl()`: `CDbl(b) * CDbl(d)`
- Never pass inline boolean expressions to `ByVal` args — use local variable first
- No `Debug.Print` interleaved with floating-point math
- Prefer `Long` over `Integer`

## Testing requirements
- Each calculation function needs unit tests
- Include edge cases: min/max values, boundary conditions
- Tolerance: ±0.1% for areas, ±1mm for dimensions
- Document source for expected values (SP:16, textbook, hand calc)

## Module Migration Rules (CRITICAL - Learned from Session 5)

### Before migrating a module:
1. Run pre-flight check: `.venv/bin/python scripts/pre_migration_check.py`
2. Check for private function usage in tests: `grep -r "module._" Python/tests/`
3. Check for type annotation usage: `grep -r "module.\w*Result" Python/structural_lib/`

### Stub Creation (Prevents 90% of migration issues):
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Just star import (misses private functions)
from structural_lib.codes.is456.tables import *  # noqa: F401, F403

# ✅ CORRECT: Star import + explicit private functions
from structural_lib.codes.is456.tables import *  # noqa: F401, F403
from structural_lib.codes.is456.tables import (  # noqa: F401
    _get_tc_for_grade,
    _PT_ROWS,
    _TC_COLUMNS,
)
```

### Type Annotation Re-exports:
```python
# If api.py uses `serviceability.DeflectionResult`, add to stub:
from structural_lib.data_types import (  # noqa: F401
    DeflectionResult,
    CrackWidthResult,
)
```

### Monkeypatch in Tests:
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Patching stub module (patch goes to wrong location)
monkeypatch.setattr(flexure, "calculate_mu_lim", mock_fn)

# ✅ CORRECT: Patch at source location
from structural_lib.codes.is456 import flexure as flexure_source
monkeypatch.setattr(flexure_source, "calculate_mu_lim", mock_fn)
```

### Import Order (Prevents E402):
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Logger before imports
_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
from structural_lib.data_types import Result  # E402!

# ✅ CORRECT: All imports at top
from structural_lib.data_types import Result
_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

### Validation Commands:
```bash
# Validate all stub exports
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_stub_exports.py --all

# Update __init__.py exports
.venv/bin/python scripts/update_is456_init.py --apply

# Full research doc: docs/research/migration-issues-analysis.md
```

## Test Writing Rules (CRITICAL - Prevents 80% of Test Failures)

### Before writing ANY test:
1. **READ the actual function signature** - don't assume args
   ```bash
   grep -A20 "def function_name" streamlit_app/utils/*.py
   ```
2. **CHECK conftest.py** for existing mocks - don't duplicate
   ```bash
   grep -E "class Mock|def mock_" streamlit_app/tests/conftest.py
   ```
3. **VERIFY return types** - dict vs bool vs tuple matters

### Streamlit Mock Assertions:
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Regular methods don't have .called
assert mock_streamlit.markdown.called  # AttributeError!

# ✅ CORRECT Option 1: Just verify no exception
show_skeleton_loader(rows=3)
assert True  # Function ran without error

# ✅ CORRECT Option 2: Set up MagicMock first
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
mock_streamlit.info = MagicMock()
show_performance_stats()
assert mock_streamlit.info.called  # Works because we used MagicMock
```

### Session State Patterns:
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Replaces MockSessionState with dict
mock_streamlit.session_state = {"key": "value"}

# ✅ CORRECT: Updates existing MockSessionState
mock_streamlit.session_state["key"] = "value"
```

### Never Duplicate Mocks:
- MockStreamlit lives in `streamlit_app/tests/conftest.py`
- Never define your own MockStreamlit class in test files
- If conftest mock is missing features, ADD to conftest, don't create local

### API Signature Verification Checklist:
Before testing a function, verify:
- [ ] Number of required positional args
- [ ] Keyword argument names (min_value vs min_val)
- [ ] Return type (dict vs bool vs tuple)
- [ ] Whether it's a context manager (use `with`)

## Role context (see agents/*.md for full details)
When working on specific task types, apply these focuses:
- **Implementation:** Layer-aware, clause refs in comments, Mac-safe
- **Testing:** Benchmark sources, edge cases, tolerance specs
- **Integration:** Schema validation, unit mapping, error surfacing
- **Docs:** API examples, units documented, changelog entries
---

## Terminal and command rules (CRITICAL)

### Python environment:
- **Always use full venv path:** `"/path/to/.venv/bin/python"` not just `python`
- Run `configure_python_environment` first if `python` command fails
- The venv is at: `.venv/bin/python` relative to project root

### Running tests locally:
```bash
# ALWAYS run tests locally before pushing new test files
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_<file>.py -v

# Check formatting/linting locally before commit
.venv/bin/python -m black <file>
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check <file>
```

### Streamlit validation (CRITICAL - read this!):
```bash
# Run AST scanner to check for NameError, ZeroDivisionError, etc.
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_streamlit_issues.py --all-pages

# Run pylint on Streamlit code
.venv/bin/python -m pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc-streamlit streamlit_app/

# Both run automatically in CI and pre-commit hooks
```

**Scanner capabilities:**
- ✅ Detects NameError (undefined variables)
- ✅ Detects ZeroDivisionError (unprotected division)
- ✅ Detects AttributeError (missing session state keys)
- ✅ Detects KeyError (dict access without checks)
- ✅ Detects ImportError (missing imports)
- ✅ Intelligent: recognizes zero-validation patterns (ternary, if-blocks, compound conditions)
- ✅ Zero false positives for division operations (as of 2026-01-09)

**When editing Streamlit code:**
1. Run scanner before committing: `.venv/bin/python scripts/check_streamlit_issues.py <file>`
2. Fix any CRITICAL issues (scanner blocks on critical)
3. HIGH issues are warnings (session state patterns - not blocking)
4. Scanner runs automatically in pre-commit and CI

### gh CLI commands:
- `gh pr checks <num>` may show "no checks" if CI hasn't started — wait 5-10 seconds
- If `gh pr merge` fails with "not mergeable", CI is still running — use `gh pr checks <num> --watch`
- If `gh pr checks --watch` times out, rerun (or increase timeout) — checks are often still running
- Network timeouts happen — retry the command once before investigating
- If PR is **behind** base branch, update it: `gh pr update-branch <num>` then re-check CI

### Git sync issues (CRITICAL - read this to avoid conflicts):

**⚠️ RECOMMENDED: Use the automated script to prevent all issues:**
```bash
# This script handles everything automatically (pre-commit, pull, merge, push)
./scripts/safe_push.sh "your commit message"

# The script:
# 1. Detects unfinished merges and completes them
# 2. Handles pre-commit hook modifications
# 3. Pulls before pushing (prevents conflicts)
# 4. Auto-resolves conflicts (keeps your version)
# 5. Pushes safely
```

**If you MUST do manual workflow:**

```bash
# ALWAYS check for unfinished merges FIRST!
if [ -f .git/MERGE_HEAD ]; then
  echo "Unfinished merge detected!"
  git commit --no-edit  # Complete the merge
  git push              # Push merged changes
  exit 0               # Stop here, don't create new commit
fi

# Step 1: Stage files
git add <files>

# Step 2: Commit (pre-commit hooks will modify files)
git commit -m "message"

# Step 3: If pre-commit modified files, they're now unstaged
# Re-stage them and amend the commit:
if git status --porcelain | grep -q '^[MARC]'; then
  git add -A
  git commit --amend --no-edit
fi

# Step 4: ALWAYS pull before push (use merge, not rebase)
git pull --no-rebase origin main

# Step 5: If merge conflict, keep your version (you have latest changes)
if [ -f .git/MERGE_HEAD ]; then
  # There are conflicts
  git checkout --ours docs/TASKS.md  # Or other conflicted files
  git add docs/TASKS.md
  git commit --no-edit
fi

# Step 6: Now safe to push
git push
```

**Common issues:**
- **Unfinished merge (MERGE_HEAD exists)** → Run `git commit --no-edit` then `git push` (DON'T create new commit!)
- Push rejected (non-fast-forward) → Run `git pull --no-rebase` then push
- Merge conflict in TASKS.md → Run `git checkout --ours docs/TASKS.md && git add docs/TASKS.md && git commit --no-edit`
- Pre-commit modified files (NOT YET PUSHED) → Run `git add -A && git commit --amend --no-edit`
- Pre-commit modified files (ALREADY PUSHED) → **NEVER AMEND!** Create new commit instead: `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: apply pre-commit fixes"`

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Never use `git commit --amend` after already pushing to remote!**
- Amending rewrites history and causes divergence
- If you already pushed, make a new commit instead
- If you accidentally amended after push: `git pull --no-rebase` then resolve merge

**Why TASKS.md conflicts happen:**
- Multiple terminals/sessions editing TASKS.md simultaneously
- Solution: The safe_push.sh script handles this automatically
- Manual solution: Always pull BEFORE committing

---

## Common coding pitfalls (avoid these)

### Import hygiene
- ❌ **Don't** import classes inside functions if already imported at module level
- ✅ **Do** import `DesignError`, `Severity` at top of module
- 🔍 **Check** existing imports before adding new ones (ruff catches duplicates as F823)

### Version drift check awareness
- ✅ Research docs (`docs/research/`) are excluded from version checks
- ✅ Archive docs (`docs/_archive/`) are excluded from version checks
- 📝 These can reference external tool versions without triggering CI failure
- 🔍 If adding new doc directories, check if they need exclusion in `scripts/check_doc_versions.py`

---

## ⚠️ File Operations (Move, Delete, Rename) — CRITICAL

**NEVER manually delete, move, or rename files!** Use the safe automation scripts:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Use safe scripts
.venv/bin/python scripts/safe_file_move.py old.md new.md
.venv/bin/python scripts/safe_file_delete.py obsolete.md

# ❌ WRONG: Manual operations (breaks links!)
rm docs/old.md
mv docs/a.md docs/b.md
git rm docs/file.md
```

### Why?
- Manual operations break internal markdown links (we have 719+ links!)
- Safe scripts automatically check references and update links
- Safe scripts create backups and run validation

### Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: ALWAYS dry-run first
.venv/bin/python scripts/safe_file_move.py old.md new.md --dry-run

# Step 2: Execute if safe
.venv/bin/python scripts/safe_file_move.py old.md new.md

# Step 3: Verify links
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_links.py

# Step 4: Commit
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "refactor: move old.md to new location"
```

### Available Scripts
| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `safe_file_move.py` | Move/rename with link updates |
| `safe_file_delete.py` | Delete with reference check + backup |
| `find_orphan_files.py` | Find unreferenced docs |

```

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Type** | Classifies document purpose | Guide, Research, Reference, Architecture, Decision |
| **Audience** | Who should read this? | All Agents, Developers, Users |
| **Status** | Development stage | Draft, Review, Approved, Deprecated |
| **Importance** | Priority level | Critical (blocks work), High, Medium, Low |
| **Version** | Semantic versioning | 1.0.0 (increment on breaking changes) |

### When to Update Metadata
- ✅ **Last Updated:** Every time document changes
- ✅ **Version:** When breaking changes made (major) or new sections added (minor)
- ✅ **Status:** When development stage changes

### Archival Guidelines
- Mark as **Deprecated** when superseded by new doc
- Add **Archive after:** date for time-limited docs (e.g., session research)
- Move to `docs/_archive/` after archival date
- Always link to replacement doc if deprecated

**Full spec:** `docs/guidelines/folder-structure-governance.md` Section V

## Common mistakes to AVOID

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|------------------|
| **Using manual git commands (git add, commit, push)** | **ALWAYS use ./scripts/ai_commit.sh "message"** |
| **Doing `git commit` then trying to fix pre-commit issues** | **Use ai_commit.sh or safe_push.sh - it handles pre-commit automatically** |
| **Manual merge conflict resolution** | **Use safe_push.sh - it auto-resolves safely** |
| **Unfinished merge (MERGE_HEAD exists)** | **Run:** `./scripts/recover_git_state.sh` (or `git commit --no-edit` then `git push`) |
| **Using `git commit --amend` AFTER pushing** | **NEVER DO THIS!** Create new commit instead: `git add -A && git commit -m "fix: ..."` |
| **Running checks on subdirectory when CI checks everything** | **CRITICAL: Run `cd Python && python -m black --check .` (not `black --check structural_lib/`) - CI checks ALL of Python/ including examples/** |
| Creating Python file → commit → CI fails on black | Create → run black locally → commit (or rely on pre-commit hooks) |
| `gh pr create` → immediately `gh pr merge` | Create → `gh pr checks --watch` → wait → merge |
| Running `python` directly | Use full venv path or configure environment first |
| Multiple micro-PRs for tiny changes | Batch related changes into one PR |
| Reading a file already shown in context | Use the context provided, don't re-read |
| Running dependent commands in parallel | Run sequentially, check output between |
| Editing file without reading current content | Always read file first if there may be changes |
| Unused variables in test code | Check with `ruff check` before commit |
| Creating duplicate documentation | Check if doc exists first |
| Committing unrelated staged files | Run `git status` before commit; stage only intended files |
| Resolving merge conflicts + feature in one commit | Resolve conflicts in separate commit first, then add feature |
| PR title/description doesn't match actual changes | List ALL changed files in PR body; update title if scope changes |
| Pre-commit modifies files → new commit | Use `git add -A && git commit --amend --no-edit` **ONLY IF NOT YET PUSHED** |
| Using `git reset --hard` without checking status | Use `git switch main && git pull --ff-only` after merge |
| Claiming "focused commit" but batching unrelated changes | Either truly separate, or be honest about batching scope |
| Tagging a release with a dirty working tree | Run `git status -sb` after `scripts/release.py`; tag only when clean |
| Verifying PyPI in an existing venv | Use a fresh venv for `pip install structural-lib-is456==X.Y.Z` |
| CI fails on formatting | Run `black`/`ruff` locally, commit, push |
| Accessing Optional[T] attributes without None check | Always check: `obj.attr if obj else default` - run mypy locally first |
| CI shows old formatting failure | Re-run checks after pushing formatting fix |
| Importing classes both at module level AND in functions | Import at module level only (ruff F823); only use function-level for circular imports |
| Adding docs with version numbers triggering drift check | Check if directory needs exclusion in `scripts/check_doc_versions.py` SKIP_FILES |

## Session workflow (CRITICAL)

### Starting a session:
```bash
# Run at the beginning of each session:
.venv/bin/python scripts/start_session.py

# Quick mode (skip test count check):
.venv/bin/python scripts/start_session.py --quick
```

**What it does:**
- Shows version, branch, uncommitted changes
- Adds SESSION_LOG entry for today if missing
- Shows Active tasks from TASKS.md
- Runs doc freshness checks

### Ending a session:
```bash
# Run before ending any session:
.venv/bin/python scripts/end_session.py

# Auto-fix issues:
.venv/bin/python scripts/end_session.py --fix

# Quick mode:
.venv/bin/python scripts/end_session.py --quick
```

**What it checks:**
- 📁 Uncommitted changes
- 🔍 Handoff checks (date freshness, test counts, versions)
- 📝 SESSION_LOG entry completeness
- 🔗 Doc link validity
- 📊 Today's activity summary

### Manual handoff steps (if needed):
1. Update `docs/planning/next-session-brief.md` with session summary
2. Ensure TASKS.md reflects current state
3. Commit any uncommitted doc changes
4. Use `docs/handoff.md` as the short resume template

---

## Efficiency rules

1. **Don't re-read files in context** — If file content is shown, use it
2. **Batch file edits** — Use multi_replace for multiple edits in same/different files
3. **Check command exit codes** — Before proceeding, verify command succeeded
4. **One terminal command at a time** — Don't run parallel terminal commands
5. **Verify before declaring success** — Run tests, check output, confirm behavior
6. **Read this file first** — Before starting any session, review these rules completely
---

## 🧠 Automation-First Mentality (CRITICAL)

**Core Principles for Every Session:**

### 1. Pattern Recognition → Automation
- If you see **10+ similar issues** → build automation script FIRST
- Never manually fix repetitive issues one-by-one
- Example: 396 broken links? Create `fix_broken_links.py`, not manual edits

### 2. Research Before Action
- Check existing scripts in `scripts/` before writing new ones
- Understand the problem scope before starting work
- Plan the approach, estimate effort, then execute

### 3. Build Once, Use Many
- Automation scripts save hours of future work
- Document scripts in their docstrings and README
- Example: `fix_broken_links.py` fixed 213 links in 5 seconds vs hours manually

### 4. Commit Incrementally
- Use Agent 8 workflow (`ai_commit.sh`) for EVERY git action
- Commit working states frequently
- Never accumulate too many changes before committing

### 5. Full Sessions, More Work
- **DO NOT stop a session early** — complete significant work chunks
- Aim for **5-10+ commits per session** for substantial progress
- If blocked on one task, move to the next rather than stopping
- End sessions only after documenting progress and updating TASKS.md

### 6. Document Everything
- Update TASKS.md, SESSION_LOG.md, and relevant docs
- Future agents (including yourself) will thank you
- If you create automation, document it in the script and reference docs

**Automation Script Examples:**
```bash
# Link fixing automation
python scripts/fix_broken_links.py --fix

# Folder structure validation
python scripts/validate_folder_structure.py

# Session management
python scripts/start_session.py
python scripts/end_session.py
```
