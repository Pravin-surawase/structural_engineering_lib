# Development Timeline: 3D Visualization Project

**Status:** 🚧 In Development
**Start Date:** January 15, 2026
**Target Launch:** March 15, 2026 (8 weeks)
**Current Phase:** Week 1 - Live Preview Foundation

---

## 🎯 Quick Reference

**For AI Agents:**
- We have **8 weeks** to build this right
- Focus on **visual excellence + automation + quality**
- **Delay nice-to-haves** to V1.1 (post-launch)
- **Create demos** at every milestone
- **Document as you build**

**Current Priorities (Week 1-2):**
1. Plotly 3D mesh generation (production quality)
2. Geometry computation functions (95%+ test coverage)
3. Live preview with @st.fragment (<100ms latency)
4. 20+ test cases (including edge cases)

## 🚫 Not in MVP (Delayed to V1.1)

**These are valuable but not critical for first release:**

- DXF/PDF Drawing Export → V1.1 (Month 4)
- Material Quantity Takeoff → V1.1 (Month 4)
- Detailing Automation → V1.1 (Month 5)
- Load Combination Visualization → V1.1 (Month 5)
- Deflection Visualization → V1.1 (Month 6)
- Multi-Span Beams → V1.1 (Month 6)
- Column Design → V1.2+ (Month 7+)
- Slab Design → V1.2+ (Month 8+)
- Eurocode/ACI Support → V1.3+ (Month 10+)

**Rationale:** Focus on ONE thing done exceptionally well.
