# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- Initial scaffolding and documentation (research, development guide, quick reference, API reference updates).

- Tests expanded for flexure/shear edge cases; flanged/doubly tests marked as skipped (future scope). Pytest passes (10 passed, 2 skipped).
- Excel add-in guide improved (quickstart, testing, troubleshooting, release checklist).
- Worked examples added to API reference and VBA examples.
- Packaging warnings reduced (license handling); `Python/LICENSE` added for builds.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-10 (Planned)
- Placeholder for first implementation release (rectangular beams, flexure + shear, VBA/Python parity).
