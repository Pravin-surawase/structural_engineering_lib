# Pre-commit hook that enforces automation scripts
# This hook blocks manual git commit unless AI_COMMIT_ACTIVE or SAFE_PUSH_ACTIVE is set

# Installed via: ./scripts/install_git_hooks.sh
# Part of: Git Automation Framework (Session 19P6)
#
# When to bypass (set by automation scripts):
#   AI_COMMIT_ACTIVE=1 - Set by ai_commit.sh
#   SAFE_PUSH_ACTIVE=1 - Set by safe_push.sh

# Skip if running through automation
if [[ -n "$AI_COMMIT_ACTIVE" ]] || [[ -n "$SAFE_PUSH_ACTIVE" ]]; then
    # Allow - running through proper automation
    exit 0

# Skip if running in CI

# Skip if explicitly bypassed (for emergencies only)
