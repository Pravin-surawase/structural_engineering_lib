## 📦 WHAT WAS CREATED

### 1. **BRAINSTORM-SESSION-20260113.md** (Comprehensive Analysis)
   - 6 detailed research opportunities ranked by impact × feasibility
   - Each opportunity includes:
     - Problem statement
     - Why it matters
     - Mathematical scope
     - Automation angle
     - Effort estimates (research + dev + test)
     - Risk assessment
     - Strategic fit to v0.17.0
     - Success metrics
   - Research starting points and literature references

### 2. **RESEARCH-DECISION-MATRIX.md** (Strategic Planning)
   - Side-by-side comparison table (all 6 problems)
   - 4 strategic paths:
     - **Path A:** Quick Wins (ship in 2 weeks)
     - **Path B:** Flagship Feature (ship in 6-8 weeks)
     - **Path C:** Balanced (quick wins + plan big)
     - **Path D:** Exploratory Research (feasibility first)
   - Pros/cons for each path
   - Recommended starting point (Path C + #2)

### 3. **QUICK-DECISION-GUIDE.md** (Action Reference)
   - Fast decision tree (5 minutes)
   - 3 recommended combos with timelines
   - Quick problem summaries with effort
   - Poll: Pick A-F to start
   - Immediate next steps based on choice

## 🎯 THE 6 PROBLEMS (RANKED)

| Rank | Problem | Type | Effort | Impact | Recommendation |
|------|---------|------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Bar Placement Optimization** | Discrete optimization | 17 days | Flagship feature | Best ROI for v0.18+ |
| 2 | **Effective Depth Solver** | Univariate search | 4-5 days | Quick win | **START HERE** for v0.17 |
| 3 | **Congestion Analysis** | Constraint checking | 7-8 days | Quality improvement | **ADD to #2** in sprint |
| 4 | **Crack Width Prediction** | Empirical modeling | 9-11 days | Completeness | For v0.17 serviceability |
| 5 | **Probabilistic Design** | Monte Carlo UQ | 22 days | Advanced feature | Research-phase only |
| 6 | **Multi-Span Beams** | Structural FEA | 28-30 days | Major expansion | Plan for v0.18/v1.0 |

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION: PATH C (Balanced Approach)

**Why?**
- Ships user value in weeks 1-2 (#2 effective depth = 4-5 days)
- Adds quality baseline in week 2 (#6 congestion = 7-8 days)
- Week 3-4: Research #1 properly (no time pressure)
- By week 5-8: Decide on next flagship (#1 or #4)

**Timeline:**
```
Week 1 (by Jan 20):  #2 Done → v0.17.1 ships
Week 2 (by Jan 27):  #6 Done → v0.17.1 released with 2 features
Week 3-4 (by Feb 10): #1 Research → decision on commitment
Week 5-8 (by Mar 10): Either #1 or pivot based on findings
```

**Why not alternatives?**
- Path A (Quick only): Defers innovation indefinitely
- Path B (Flagship only): Risks 6 weeks with no user value
- Path D (Research only): Delays shipping for 2 weeks without features

## ✅ YOUR NEXT ACTION: PICK ONE

**Reply with A, B, C, D, E, or F:**

```
A. "I want to sprint — ship #2 in 1 week"
   → I'll create detailed spec + pseudocode for Depth Solver
   → You can start coding TODAY

B. "I want the flagship — research #1 deeply"
   → I'll create 2-week research plan (lit review, algorithms, validation)
   → Start research immediately

C. "I want balanced — do #2 + #6 then research #1"
   → I'll create specs for both quick features
   → Then plan #1 research after shipping

D. "I want to validate first — explore top 3"
   → I'll create 2-day deep-dive for #1, #2, #6
   → Report findings in 1 week, then decide

E. "I want quality baseline — focus on #6"
   → I'll create detailed spec for congestion analysis
   → Ships in ~1 week, high professional value

F. "I want something different"
   → Tell me what's on your mind!
   → Let's adjust the brainstorm
```
