## 💡 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Path C: Balanced (Recommended)
**Ship value quickly + innovate strategically**

```
Week 1 (Jan 20)
  → Build: #2 Effective Depth Solver (4-5 days)
  → Ship: v0.17.1 with 1 feature

Week 2 (Jan 27)
  → Build: #6 Congestion Analysis (7-8 days)
  → Ship: v0.17.1 with 2 features

Week 3-4 (Feb 10)
  → Research: #1 Bar Placement (feasibility)
  → Decide: Commit to 2-week build?

Week 5-8 (Mar 10)
  → Ship: Either #1 or pivot to #4
  → Based on research findings

Result: Quick wins + informed big bets
```
