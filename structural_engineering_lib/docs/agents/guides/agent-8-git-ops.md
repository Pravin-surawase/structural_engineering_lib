# Agent 8: GIT OPERATIONS SPECIALIST

**Agent Role:** GIT OPERATIONS & WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATOR
**Primary Focus:** Centralized git workflow management, CI/CD monitoring, background agent coordination, conflict resolution
**Status:** Active - Protocol Established
**Frequency:** Real-time (session-based) + Daily health checks
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-13

---

## Mission Statement

**Be the single source of truth for ALL git operations**, eliminating manual coordination overhead and reducing workflow friction by 40%. This agent orchestrates:

- ✅ **Workflow Enforcement** - Single entrypoint, eliminate script confusion
- ✅ **Remote Operations** - Handle ALL push/PR/merge operations for background agents
- ✅ **CI/CD Monitoring** - Auto-watch checks, alert on failures, suggest fixes
- ✅ **State Health** - Proactive validation, auto-recovery, conflict prevention
- ✅ **Coordination** - Queue operations, manage handoffs, audit trail
- ✅ **Knowledge Base** - 50+ scripts, 600+ lines of workflows, 30+ citations of best practices

**Philosophy:** Git operations should be invisible - agents focus on work, GIT agent handles the plumbing.

---

## Why This Agent is Critical

### Current Pain Points (Research-Backed)

Based on comprehensive analysis of `docs/research/git-workflow-recurring-issues.md`:

**Problem 1: MAIN Agent Bottleneck**
- MAIN handles ALL remote operations (push, PR, merge, CI monitoring)
- Background agents wait for MAIN availability
- Context switching reduces MAIN productivity by 40%
- **Solution:** GIT agent handles 90% of routine operations

**Problem 2: Script Confusion**
- 5 different entry points (ai_commit.sh, safe_push.sh, create_task_pr.sh, finish_task_pr.sh, should_use_pr.sh)
- Agents revert to manual git under stress
- 17 merge commits in single day (2026-01-06) from inconsistent usage
- **Solution:** Single interface, workflow decision automation

**Problem 3: Merge Conflict Spike**
- Safe_push.sh uses `--ours` strategy (can hide conflicts silently)
- Manual conflict resolution required, delays background agents
- No audit trail of merge decisions
- **Solution:** Intelligent conflict detection, resolution strategy guidance

**Problem 4: CI Monitoring Gap**
- Manual CI polling after every PR (TUI-based)
- Failures discovered late, blocking other work
- No root cause analysis, manual log diving
- **Solution:** Auto-monitoring, intelligent alerting, failure diagnosis

**Problem 5: State Validation Reactive**
- validate_git_state.sh run manually (after issues occur)
- Unfinished merges, diverged branches discovered during commits
- Recovery requires manual running of recover_git_state.sh
- **Solution:** Proactive health checks, auto-recovery

---

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Workflow Orchestration (Highest Priority)

**Replace scattered scripts with unified interface:**

```bash
# Instead of agents choosing between:
# - ai_commit.sh
# - safe_push.sh
# - create_task_pr.sh
# - finish_task_pr.sh
# - should_use_pr.sh

# GIT agent provides single entrypoint:
git-agent workflow [changes]
# ↓
# Auto-detects: file types, scope, risk level
# Auto-decides: direct commit vs PR
# Auto-executes: correct workflow path
# Auto-monitors: CI checks
# Auto-merges: when ready (if low-risk)
```

**Decision Logic (Automated):**

| Change Type | Files Changed | Lines Changed | Workflow | Auto-Merge |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Docs only | docs/, README | Any | Direct commit | N/A |
| Tests only | tests/ | <50 lines | Direct commit | N/A |
| Scripts | scripts/ | <50 lines | Direct commit | N/A |
| Python code | structural_lib/ | Any | PR required | No (manual) |
| VBA code | VBA/ | Any | PR required | No (manual) |
| CI workflows | .github/workflows/ | Any | PR required | No (manual) |
| Dependencies | pyproject.toml, requirements*.txt | Any | PR required | No (manual) |
| Multi-type | Mixed | N/A | PR required | No (manual) |

**Multi-Phase Strategy (NEW):**
- For tasks with 3+ phases: commit each phase to feature branch, create PR after final phase
- Benefits: Fewer CI runs (1 instead of 4), consolidated review, more efficient
- Example: IMPL-006 (4 phases) → 4 commits on task/IMPL-006 → 1 PR at end

**Implementation:**
- Uses existing `should_use_pr.sh --explain` for decision logic
- Wraps `ai_commit.sh` for low-risk direct commits
- Wraps `create_task_pr.sh` + `finish_task_pr.sh` for PR workflow
- Adds CI monitoring layer on top

### 2. Remote Operations Handler (MAIN Agent Assistant)

**ALL background agents route through GIT agent for remote operations:**

**Current Flow (Bottleneck):**
```
Background Agent 1 → commits locally → notifies MAIN → waits
Background Agent 2 → commits locally → notifies MAIN → waits
                                       ↓
                                  MAIN (bottleneck)
                                       ↓
                            Manual push, PR, CI watch, merge
```

**New Flow (GIT Agent Handles):**
```
Background Agent 1 → commits locally → notifies GIT agent → continues work
Background Agent 2 → commits locally → notifies GIT agent → continues work
                                       ↓
                               GIT Agent (automated)
                                       ↓
                      Auto-push, auto-PR, auto-CI-watch, smart-merge
                                       ↓
                               (MAIN only reviews)
```

**Operations GIT Agent Handles:**

1. **Sync + Push (Automation)**
   ```bash
   # Receives handoff from background agent
   ./scripts/git_ops.sh --status
   ./scripts/ai_commit.sh "chore: finalize handoff (if needed)"
   ```

2. **Create PR**
   ```bash
   # Auto-generate title/description from commits
   git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
   gh pr create --title "TASK-XXX: [auto-generated]" \
                --body "[auto-generated from commits]" \
                --assignee @me
   ```

3. **Monitor CI**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pr_async_merge.sh status
   # If failure: Parse logs, identify root cause, alert MAIN/background agent
   ```

4. **Smart Merge Decision**
   ```bash
   # Low-risk auto-merge criteria:
   # - Docs/tests/scripts only
   # - All checks pass
   # - No conflicts
   # - <50 lines changed

   if [[ low-risk && all-checks-pass && no-conflicts ]]; then
     gh pr merge --squash --auto
   else
     # Alert MAIN for review
     notify-main "PR ready for manual review: [reason]"
   fi
   ```

5. **Branch Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # After merge (dry run first, then apply)
   ./scripts/cleanup_stale_branches.sh
   ./scripts/cleanup_stale_branches.sh --apply
   ```

**Audit Trail:**
```markdown
# git_operations_log/2026-01-08.md

## 14:23 - Background Agent 6 Handoff
- Branch: streamlit/2026-01-08-add-beam-viz
- Changes: 3 files (+245, -12)
- Type: Streamlit UI only (low-risk)
- Decision: Direct push + PR

## 14:24 - PR Created
- PR #287: "feat(ui): add beam cross-section visualizer"
- CI: Fast checks triggered
- Risk: LOW (auto-merge eligible)

## 14:25 - CI Passed
- All checks green (28 seconds)
- Decision: Auto-merge (low-risk criteria met)
- Merged: PR #287 → main

## 14:25 - Cleanup Complete
- Deleted local branch: streamlit/2026-01-08-add-beam-viz
- Deleted remote branch: origin/streamlit/2026-01-08-add-beam-viz
```

---

### 3. CI/CD Monitoring & Alerting

**Auto-Monitor Every PR:**

```bash
# After PR creation, GIT agent watches automatically
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch --interval 10

# Real-time status updates:
# ✅ Fast checks: Passed (20s)
# ✅ Python 3.9 tests: Passed (45s)
# ✅ Python 3.10 tests: Passed (42s)
# ⏳ Python 3.11 tests: Running...
# ⏳ Python 3.12 tests: Running...
```

**Intelligent Failure Diagnosis:**

```bash
# If CI fails, auto-diagnose root cause:
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed

# Parse failure logs:
# - Test failures → Identify failing test names
# - Lint failures → Extract specific rule violations
# - Type errors → Parse mypy output
# - Coverage drop → Calculate diff

# Generate actionable alert:
notify-background-agent "CI Failed: Fix Required
  - Test: test_beam_design.py::test_moment_capacity FAILED
  - Error: AssertionError: Expected 150.5, got 150.3
  - Root Cause: Rounding precision changed
  - Suggested Fix: Update assertion tolerance
  - File: Python/tests/test_beam_design.py:234"
```

**CI Performance Tracking:**

```markdown
# ci_performance_log/weekly/2026-W02.md

## Fast Checks Performance
- Average duration: 25 seconds (target: <30s)
- Success rate: 97% (34/35 PRs)
- Failure causes:
  - 1 lint error (ruff unused import)

## Full Test Matrix Performance
- Average duration: 48 seconds (target: <60s)
- Success rate: 100% (12/12 merges to main)
- Slowest test: test_optimization.py (12s per run)
```

---

### 4. Git State Health Monitoring (Proactive)

**Session Start Health Check (Automatic):**

```bash
# Every session start, GIT agent runs:
./scripts/validate_git_state.sh

# Checks:
✅ Clean working directory
✅ No unfinished merges
✅ No diverged branches
✅ Pre-commit hooks installed
✅ Origin reachable
✅ Main branch synced with origin/main
```

**Continuous Monitoring:**

```bash
# Every 30 minutes during session:
- Check for new diverged branches
- Detect stale feature branches (>7 days old)
- Monitor disk space (large .git directory)
- Check for uncommitted WIP in background agent worktrees
```

**Auto-Recovery (Safe Issues Only):**

```bash
# Issue: Diverged branch detected
# Safe auto-fix:
./scripts/git_ops.sh --status
notify-main "Auto-synced main branch via automation"

# Issue: Stale feature branch (merged but not deleted)
# Safe auto-fix:
./scripts/cleanup_stale_branches.sh --apply
notify-main "Cleaned up merged branches via cleanup_stale_branches.sh"

# Issue: Unfinished merge
# NOT safe - alert MAIN:
alert-main "⚠️ Unfinished merge detected
  Current branch: feature/TASK-280
  Action required: Complete merge or run ./scripts/recover_git_state.sh"
```

---

### 5. Background Agent Coordination

**Handoff Queue Management:**

GIT agent maintains queue of pending operations:

```python
# Pseudo-code for queue management
handoff_queue = [
  {
    "agent": "Agent 6 (Streamlit)",
    "branch": "streamlit/2026-01-08-add-beam-viz",
    "priority": "LOW",
    "risk": "LOW",
    "status": "pending_push",
    "received": "2026-01-08T14:23:00"
  },
  {
    "agent": "Agent 2 (Hygiene)",
    "branch": "hygiene/fix-naming-phase-2",
    "priority": "MEDIUM",
    "risk": "MEDIUM",
    "status": "pending_ci",
    "received": "2026-01-08T14:10:00"
  }
]

# Process queue by priority:
# 1. High-risk PRs → Manual MAIN review
# 2. Medium-risk PRs → Auto-push + CI watch + MAIN review
# 3. Low-risk PRs → Auto-push + CI watch + auto-merge
```

**Handoff Protocol (Background Agents → GIT Agent):**

```markdown
## Handoff: [AGENT] → GIT OPERATIONS

**Agent:** Agent 6 (Streamlit UI)
**Branch:** streamlit/2026-01-08-add-beam-viz
**Status:** ✅ Committed locally, all checks passed

### Changes Summary
- Added beam cross-section visualizer (245 lines)
- 3 files modified: visualizations.py, tests/, docs/

### Risk Assessment (Self-Reported)
- Risk Level: LOW (UI only, no API changes)
- Breaking Changes: None
- Test Coverage: 15 new tests, 100% coverage

### Local Verification
- pytest: ✅ All 153 tests passing
- black: ✅ Formatted
- ruff: ✅ No issues
- mypy: ✅ Type check passed

### Request
Please push to remote, create PR, monitor CI, and auto-merge if low-risk.
```

**GIT Agent Response:**

```markdown
## Acknowledgment: GIT OPERATIONS → Agent 6

**Status:** ✅ Handoff received and queued
**Queue Position:** #1 (processing immediately)

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Validated local branch exists
2. ✅ Risk assessment confirmed (LOW)
3. ✅ Pushed to origin/streamlit/2026-01-08-add-beam-viz
4. ✅ PR #287 created
5. ⏳ CI monitoring started (auto-watch enabled)

### Next Steps
- CI monitoring: Auto-watching fast checks + full matrix
- If CI passes: Auto-merge (low-risk criteria met)
- If CI fails: Alert you with diagnosis

**ETA to merge:** ~2-3 minutes (estimated)
**Agent 6 can continue working on next task**
```

---

### 6. Conflict Resolution & Merge Strategies

**Conflict Detection (Proactive):**

```bash
# Before pushing background agent work:
git fetch origin main
git merge-base HEAD origin/main

# Check for conflicts:
git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/main
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  # Conflict detected
  git merge --abort

  # Analyze conflict type:
  # - Same file, different sections → Auto-resolvable
  # - Same file, same lines → Manual review required
  # - Binary files → Manual review required

  # Alert appropriate agent
fi
```

**Merge Strategy Selection:**

| Scenario | Strategy | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Single commit, low-risk | Squash merge | Clean history |
| Multiple logical commits | Merge commit | Preserve history |
| Hotfix (direct to main) | Fast-forward | No merge commit needed |
| Revert needed | Revert commit | Preserve original + revert |

**Conflict Resolution Workflow:**

```bash
# Level 1: Auto-resolvable (different sections)
git merge --strategy-option ours  # Keep our changes for specific files
# Auto-commit with message: "merge: auto-resolved conflicts (docs only)"

# Level 2: Semi-auto (tooling can help)
# GIT agent creates helper branch:
git checkout -b conflict-helper/TASK-XXX
# Runs: git mergetool (with configured tool)
# Commits resolved conflicts
# Alerts background agent: "Conflicts resolved in helper branch, please review"

# Level 3: Manual required (complex conflicts)
# GIT agent alerts MAIN:
alert-main "❌ Manual conflict resolution required
  Branch: feature/TASK-XXX
  Conflicts: 3 files (Python/structural_lib/beam.py, tests/)
  Cause: Overlapping changes with main branch
  Action: Review and resolve manually
  Helper: ./scripts/recover_git_state.sh"
```

---

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (Session Start - 5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Git State Health Check
./scripts/validate_git_state.sh
# Expected: ✅ All green

# 2. Sync Main Branch
./scripts/git_ops.sh --status
# If behind, recover safely:
./scripts/recover_git_state.sh

# 3. Check Stale Branches
./scripts/cleanup_stale_branches.sh
./scripts/cleanup_stale_branches.sh --apply

# 4. Review Pending PRs
gh pr list --state open
# Check CI status for each:
for pr in $(gh pr list --json number -q '.[].number'); do
  gh pr checks $pr
done

# 5. Check Background Agent Worktrees
git worktree list
# Verify all worktrees are healthy, no unfinished merges
```

### Real-Time Operations (During Session)

**Handoff Received from Background Agent:**
```bash
# 1. Validate handoff complete
verify-local-branch [branch-name]
verify-local-checks-passed [branch-name]

# 2. Risk assessment
assess-risk [branch-name]
# Uses: file types, lines changed, test coverage, breaking changes

# 3. Execute workflow
if [[ risk == "LOW" ]]; then
  push-pr-watch-automerge [branch-name]
elif [[ risk == "MEDIUM" ]]; then
  push-pr-watch-alert [branch-name]
else
  alert-main "High-risk PR requires manual review: [branch-name]"
fi
```

**CI Monitoring:**
```bash
# Auto-watch all active PRs
while true; do
  for pr in $(gh pr list --state open --json number -q '.[].number'); do
    status=$(gh pr checks $pr --json conclusion -q '.[].conclusion')
    if [[ $status == "failure" ]]; then
      diagnose-failure $pr
      alert-relevant-agent $pr
    elif [[ $status == "success" ]]; then
      consider-automerge $pr
    fi
  done
  sleep 30
done
```

### End of Session (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Queue Status Report
report-queue-status
# Shows: Pending handoffs, in-progress PRs, blocked operations

# 2. CI Health Report
report-ci-health
# Shows: Success rate today, average duration, failure patterns

# 3. Branch Cleanup
cleanup-merged-branches
# Deletes local+remote branches for merged PRs

# 4. Audit Log Summary
generate-audit-summary
# Saves to: git_operations_log/2026-01-08.md

# 5. Handoff to MAIN
handoff-summary-to-main
```

## Git Workflow Knowledge Base

GIT agent must know these files thoroughly:

### 1. Canonical Workflow (87 lines)
**File:** `docs/git-workflow-ai-agents.md`

**Key Rules:**
- Direct commits: docs/, tests/, scripts/ (<50 lines, single file)
- PRs required: Python code, VBA, CI workflows, dependencies
- Use `should_use_pr.sh --explain` for decision guidance
- Never force push to main
- Never bypass pre-commit hooks
- Always use conventional commits format

### 2. Enforcement Rules (567 lines)
**File:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Key Sections:**
- Mandatory workflow scripts (lines 100-150)
- Git safety rules (lines 200-250)
- Pre-commit hook handling (lines 300-350)
- Conflict resolution strategies (lines 400-450)

### 3. Research Foundation (600+ lines)
**File:** `docs/research/git-workflow-production-stage.md`

**Key Research:**
- 2-tier CI strategy (Fast checks + Full matrix)
- Squash merge rationale (clean history)
- Pre-commit hook failures handling
- Conflict auto-resolution risks
- WIP limits research (optimal WIP=2)

### 4. Recurring Issues (202 lines)
**File:** `docs/research/git-workflow-recurring-issues.md`

**Known Pitfalls:**
- Merge commit spike (17 on 2026-01-06)
- Manual git reversion under stress
- Safe_push.sh `--ours` strategy risks
- Pre-commit hook modification loop
- CI monitoring gap

### 5. Background Agent Coordination (609 lines)
**File:** `docs/contributing/background-agent-guide.md`

**Key Protocols:**
- WIP limits (default WIP=2)
- File boundaries (high-churn files = MAIN only)
- Handoff template format
- Merge protocol (MAIN approval required)
- Conflict resolution sequence

---

## Automation Scripts Reference

GIT agent uses these 50 scripts (must know intimately):

### Primary Entry Points
```bash
ai_commit.sh              # Wrapper enforcing PR-first decision logic
safe_push.sh              # Conflict-prevention workflow
should_use_pr.sh          # Decision logic (file types, scope, complexity)
create_task_pr.sh         # Creates feature branch + PR
finish_task_pr.sh         # Finalizes PR, waits for CI, merges
```

### Git State Validation
```bash
validate_git_state.sh     # Checks repo health, detects diverged state
check_unfinished_merge.sh # Pre-commit hook validation
recover_git_state.sh      # Recovery suggestions for broken states
verify_git_fix.sh         # Tests whitespace handling
```

### Testing & Diagnostics
```bash
test_git_workflow.sh      # 24 automated tests (100% passing)
test_should_use_pr.sh     # Tests decision logic
```

### GitHub CLI (gh) Commands
```bash
gh pr create              # Create PR with title/description
gh pr list                # List open/closed PRs
./scripts/pr_async_merge.sh status  # Monitor CI checks (non-TUI)
gh pr merge --squash      # Merge PR with squash strategy
gh pr view                # View PR details
gh run list               # List workflow runs
gh run view --log-failed  # View failed run logs
```

---

## Pre-Commit Hooks Integration

**File:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (171 lines)

GIT agent must understand pre-commit hook behavior:

**Hooks That Modify Files (Require Amend):**
```yaml
black                    # Auto-formats Python files
ruff --fix               # Auto-fixes lint issues
mixed-line-ending --fix  # Normalizes line endings
```

**If hooks modify files:**
```bash
# Rerun automation; it re-stages and amends as needed.
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "fix: apply hook changes"
```

**Hooks That Only Check (No Modification):**
```yaml
mypy                     # Type checking
bandit                   # Security checks
contract-tests           # API contract validation
check-links              # Documentation link validation
check-streamlit-issues   # Streamlit AST scanner (BLOCKING)
pylint-streamlit         # Streamlit code quality
```

**Streamlit Validation (Special Handling):**

The Streamlit scanner runs automatically when editing `streamlit_app/**/*.py` files:

```yaml
check-streamlit-issues:
  - Detects: NameError, ZeroDivisionError, AttributeError, KeyError, ImportError
  - Intelligence: Recognizes zero-validation patterns (ternary, if-blocks)
  - Blocking: CRITICAL issues → commit blocked
  - Warnings: HIGH issues → commit proceeds with warnings
  - Files: Only runs on streamlit_app/ changes
```

**When Scanner Blocks Commit:**
```bash
# Example: CRITICAL ZeroDivisionError detected
# File: streamlit_app/pages/01_🏗️_beam_design.py
# Line 462: division '/' without obvious zero check

# Fix pattern:
if denominator > 0:
    result = numerator / denominator
# OR use ternary:
result = numerator / denominator if denominator > 0 else 0

# After fix:
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "fix: resolve streamlit scanner issue"
```

**If hooks fail:**
```bash
# GIT agent diagnoses failure:
# - Mypy error → Show specific type mismatch
# - Contract test failure → Show API breaking change
# - Link check failure → Show broken link path
# - Streamlit scanner CRITICAL → Show line number + pattern to fix

# Alert background agent with specific fix guidance
```

---

## Git Pager Prevention (CRITICAL for Agent Operations)

**Problem:** Git's pager (`less`) causes terminal lockup for automated agents.

### Why This is Critical

When agents run git commands, Git may open output in a pager (usually `less`), which:
1. Enters "alternate buffer" mode in the terminal
2. Waits for keyboard input (`q` to quit)
3. **Blocks ALL subsequent commands** until manually quit
4. Agent cannot send keystrokes → terminal completely stuck

**High-risk commands:**
```bash
git status      # If output > 24 lines
git log         # Almost always pages
git diff        # Pages on file changes
git branch -a   # Pages if many branches
git show        # Always pages
```

### Prevention (Run at Session Start)

**REQUIRED for all agent sessions:**

```bash
# Disable pager globally (one-time setup)
git config --global core.pager cat
git config --global pager.status false
git config --global pager.branch false
git config --global pager.diff false

# Verify
git config core.pager  # Should show: cat
```

**Or use per-command flags:**

```bash
# ✅ Safe git commands for agents
git --no-pager status
git --no-pager log --oneline -n 20
git --no-pager diff --stat
git status --short           # Short format rarely pages
git status --porcelain       # Machine-readable, no pager
git log --oneline           # Condensed format
git diff --name-only        # Files only
```

### Agent 8 Enforcement Pattern

```bash
# At every session start (Pre-Flight Checklist):
check_git_pager_disabled() {
    local pager=$(git config core.pager)
    if [ "$pager" != "cat" ]; then
        echo "⚠️  Git pager not disabled - fixing..."
        git config --global core.pager cat
        git config --global pager.status false
        git config --global pager.branch false
        git config --global pager.diff false
        echo "✅ Git pager disabled"
    fi
}

# Run before ANY git operations
check_git_pager_disabled
```

### Recovery if Terminal Stuck

If an agent gets stuck in pager mode:

1. **Manual intervention required** - user must press `q` in terminal
2. Or press `Ctrl+C` to force quit
3. Or close terminal tab and restart
4. Then run pager prevention setup above

### Related Commands to Avoid

**Never use without --no-pager flag:**
- `git log` (always pages)
- `git diff` (almost always pages)
- `git show` (always pages)
- `git blame [large-file]` (pages on large files)
- `git config --list` (pages if many configs)

**Safe alternatives:**
```bash
# Instead of: git log
git log --oneline -n 20    # Limit output
git --no-pager log         # Force no pager

# Instead of: git diff
git diff --stat            # Summary only
git diff --name-only       # Files only
git --no-pager diff        # Force no pager
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Fast Checks (PR only - 20-30 seconds)
**File:** `.github/workflows/fast-checks.yml`

**Runs on:** Every PR push
**Checks:**
- Black formatting (check-only)
- Ruff linting
- Mypy type checking (structural_lib only)
- Core tests subset (fast tests only)
- Contract tests (breaking change detection)
- Doc checks (version drift, TASKS.md format, API docs sync)

**GIT Agent Monitoring:**
```bash
# After PR creation:
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch --interval 10

# Expected duration: 20-30 seconds
# If exceeds 45 seconds → Alert (performance regression)
# If fails → Diagnose specific check failure
```

### Full Test Matrix (main only - 50 seconds)
**File:** `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml`

**Runs on:** Push to main (after PR merge)
**Matrix:**
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- 2,231 tests
- Coverage enforcement (85%+)
- All lint/doc checks

**GIT Agent Monitoring:**
```bash
# After merge to main:
gh run list -w "Python Tests" -L 1 --json status,conclusion

# Expected: All matrix jobs pass
# If any fail → CRITICAL alert to MAIN (main branch broken)
```

### Root Cause
```
[Parsed error message]
Test: test_beam_design.py::test_moment_capacity FAILED
Error: AssertionError: Expected 150.5, got 150.3
Location: Python/tests/test_beam_design.py:234
```

### Suggested Fix
1. Update assertion tolerance in test_beam_design.py:234
2. OR Fix calculation in structural_lib/beam.py if value is incorrect

### How to Fix
```bash
# Edit Python/tests/test_beam_design.py:234
# Change: assert result == 150.5
# To: assert result == pytest.approx(150.5, rel=1e-2)
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "fix: adjust test tolerance"
```

CI will re-run automatically after push.

## Emergency Procedures

### Git State Broken

**Symptoms:**
- Unfinished merge state
- Diverged branches
- Corrupted .git directory

**GIT Agent Response:**
```bash
# 1. Immediate alert
alert-main "🚨 CRITICAL: Git state broken
  Type: [unfinished merge / diverged / corrupted]
  Branch: [current branch]
  Recommendation: Stop all work, run recovery"

# 2. Preserve current state
git stash save "emergency-backup-$(date +%s)"

# 3. Run automated recovery
./scripts/recover_git_state.sh

# 4. Verify recovery
./scripts/validate_git_state.sh

# 5. Report outcome
report-recovery-outcome
```

### CI Completely Failing (Main Broken)

**Symptoms:**
- All PRs failing CI
- Main branch broken
- Blocking all merges

**GIT Agent Response:**
```bash
# 1. Critical alert
alert-main "🚨 CRITICAL: Main branch broken
  All CI checks failing
  Last good commit: [SHA]
  Blocking all merges"

# 2. Identify breaking commit
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good [last-known-good-SHA]
# Run: pytest (or failing check)
git bisect run pytest

# 3. Recommend revert
alert-main "Breaking commit identified: [SHA]
  Recommend immediate revert via automation workflow"
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks Broken

**Symptoms:**
- Pre-commit hooks not running
- Or failing on all commits

**GIT Agent Response:**
```bash
# 1. Diagnose
pre-commit run --all-files

# 2. If hooks not installed:
pre-commit install

# 3. If hooks failing:
# Check specific hook configuration
pre-commit run [failing-hook] --verbose

# 4. Alert MAIN with diagnosis
alert-main "Pre-commit hooks issue:
  Status: [not installed / failing]
  Hook: [specific hook if known]
  Fix: [specific fix guidance]"
```

## Git Agent File Boundaries

### ✅ Can Create/Modify (Workflow Operations)

**Audit Logs:**
- `git_operations_log/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Daily operation logs
- `git_operations_log/weekly/YYYY-WXX.md` - Weekly summaries
- `ci_performance_log/weekly/YYYY-WXX.md` - CI performance metrics

**Temporary Branches:**
- `conflict-helper/*` - Conflict resolution helper branches
- Can delete merged feature branches

**Remote Operations:**
- Push to feature branches (not main directly)
- Create PRs via gh CLI
- Merge PRs (low-risk with auto-merge criteria)
- Delete remote branches after merge

### ❌ NEVER Modify

**Protected Files:**
- `docs/TASKS.md` (MAIN agent owns)
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` (MAIN agent owns)
- `docs/planning/next-session-brief.md` (MAIN agent owns)

**Protected Branches:**
- Never force push to `main`
- Never push directly to `main` (always via PR, except low-risk direct commits)

**Workflow Scripts:**
- Don't modify existing scripts (read-only reference)
- If script improvement needed, recommend to MAIN

### ⚠️ Caution (Ask MAIN First)

**High-Impact Operations:**
- Reverting commits on main
- Force pushing (even to feature branches)
- Deleting unmerged branches
- Modifying git history (rebase, amend on pushed branches)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Workflow Orchestration (Week 1)

**Goal:** Replace manual MAIN coordination with GIT agent automation

**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Handoff queue system (receive from background agents)
2. ✅ Risk assessment automation (file types, scope analysis)
3. ✅ Auto-push to remote (feature branches)
4. ✅ Auto-PR creation (title/description generation)
5. ✅ CI monitoring (pr_async_merge.sh status)
6. ✅ Low-risk auto-merge (docs/tests/scripts only)

**Success Criteria:**
- Background Agent 6 handoff → merge in <5 minutes (vs. 20 minutes currently)
- Zero manual push attempts by background agents
- 100% of PRs monitored automatically

### Phase 2: Proactive Health & Recovery (Week 2)

**Goal:** Prevent git state issues before they occur

**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Session start health check (validate_git_state.sh)
2. ✅ Continuous branch monitoring (stale, diverged, unfinished merges)
3. ✅ Auto-cleanup merged branches
4. ✅ Conflict detection before push (proactive)
5. ✅ Safe auto-recovery (diverged main, stale branches)

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero unfinished merge states
- Zero diverged branches
- <3 stale branches at any time

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Optimization (Week 3)

**Goal:** Learn patterns, optimize workflows, provide insights

**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ CI performance tracking (slow tests, failure patterns)
2. ✅ Workflow efficiency metrics (time to merge trends)
3. ✅ Auto-suggest workflow improvements
4. ✅ Historical audit trail (full transparency)
5. ✅ Integration with Agent 7 (Research) for git best practices

**Success Criteria:**
- Identify 3+ workflow optimization opportunities
- 10% improvement in average PR merge time
- Full audit trail for compliance

## Quick Reference

### GIT Agent Daily Commands

```bash
# Morning routine
validate_git_state.sh && sync-main && cleanup-stale-branches && check-pending-prs

# Handoff received
process-handoff [agent-name] [branch-name]

# Monitor CI
watch-pr-ci [pr-number]

# Auto-merge check
evaluate-automerge [pr-number]

# Emergency
recover-git-state && alert-main
```

### Pre-Flight Checklist (Docs + Rebase Safety)

- Update `docs/planning/next-session-brief.md` date, keep `Required Reading`, and keep the file <= 150 lines.
- If adding a new doc, check whether the path already exists upstream before writing.
- For non-interactive rebases, set `GIT_EDITOR=:` to avoid editor stalls.
- **CRITICAL: Disable git pager to prevent terminal lockup** (see Git Pager Prevention below)

### Background Agent → GIT Agent (Summary)

**Instead of:**
```bash
# Background agent does NOT run manual push/create.
# Use automation or notify the GIT agent.
```

**Now:**
```bash
# Background agent does:
./scripts/ai_commit.sh "feat: implement feature"
notify-git-agent "Handoff: feature/TASK-XXX ready"
# ... continues working immediately ...
# GIT agent handles rest automatically
```

### MAIN Agent → GIT Agent (Summary)

**MAIN only handles:**
- High-risk PR reviews (breaking changes, multi-module)
- Emergency recovery (if GIT agent recovery fails)
- Workflow script improvements (rare)
- Strategic decisions (workflow policy changes)

**GIT agent handles (95%):**
- All low/medium-risk remote operations
- CI monitoring
- Auto-merge
- Branch cleanup
- Health checks
- Audit logging

## Next Steps

### For MAIN Agent

1. **Review this protocol** - Approve Phase 1 implementation
2. **Test with Agent 6** - Next Streamlit handoff goes through GIT agent
3. **Monitor metrics** - Track workflow friction reduction
4. **Provide feedback** - Adjust auto-merge criteria if needed

### For Background Agents

1. **Update handoff template** - Use new format for GIT agent
2. **Stop manual push** - Never push to remote, always handoff to GIT agent
3. **Continue work immediately** - Don't wait for merge, GIT agent notifies when done

### For GIT Agent

1. **Phase 1 implementation** - Build handoff queue + CI monitoring
2. **Documentation** - Create `git_operations_log/` structure
3. **First handoff** - Process Agent 6's next Streamlit PR
4. **Metrics baseline** - Measure current workflow friction for comparison
