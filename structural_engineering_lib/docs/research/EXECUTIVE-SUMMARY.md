## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Path C: Balanced Approach**

```
Week 1 (by Jan 20)
  → #2: Effective Depth Solver (4-5 days)
  → v0.17.1 ships with 1 feature

Week 2 (by Jan 27)
  → #6: Congestion Analysis (7-8 days)
  → v0.17.1 released with 2 features

Week 3-4 (by Feb 10)
  → #1: Bar Placement Research (feasibility study)
  → Decide on commitment

Week 5-8 (by Mar 10)
  → Either: Ship #1 (flagship)
  → Or: Pivot to #4 (multi-span)
```

**Why?**
- Ships value every 1-2 weeks (keeps team motivated)
- De-risks big features (#1) with preliminary research
- Flexible: Can adjust based on user feedback
- Professional: Incremental quality improvements + innovation
