# Function Catalog Research
**Purpose:** Create a complete, beginner-friendly guide to every function in the structural_lib library

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-01-13)

**Outputs:**
- ✅ `START-HERE.md` — **Read this first!** Navigation guide for all files
- ✅ `NEW-DEVELOPER-ONBOARDING.md` — Full onboarding for new developers (mission, layers, code)
- ✅ `QUICK-START.md` — Run your first beam design in 5 minutes
- ✅ `FUNCTION-GUIDE.md` — Complete reference of every function (ELI5 style)
- ✅ `RESEARCH_PLAN.md` — Today's one-day research plan

**For:** New developers learning the codebase

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Read in this order:**
1. **START-HERE.md** (this page tells you what to read)
2. **NEW-DEVELOPER-ONBOARDING.md** (understand the project)
3. **QUICK-START.md** (run your first beam)
4. **FUNCTION-GUIDE.md** (reference for all functions)

## ⚡ Super Quick Summary

**What is this library?**
A tool that tells you how much steel a concrete beam needs, using IS 456 rules.

**How do you use it?**
Pass beam dimensions + loads → get required steel.

**Can I really learn this in one day?**
Yes! Start with `START-HERE.md` and `NEW-DEVELOPER-ONBOARDING.md` (35 min). Then run `QUICK-START.md` (5 min). You'll understand the basics and be able to design beams.
